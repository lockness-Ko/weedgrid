RT @zaptiee : Had to delete all of my tweets because a copyright troll who has targeted @nicholasdeorio and @AugieRFC is now targeting me. They managed to DMCA takedown a tweet only containing a link to my own podcast. Nick is now suspended. This is beyond fucked.
RT @JohnSwanYT : This is the reason I have always deleted my tweets in the past. I may have to do it more frequently if Twitter does nothing to fix this glaring exploit.
RT @JohnSwanYT : Despite all of this, I'm pretty confident Nick will get his account back because he has some people behind the scenes that can help. But for most others, once you're banned, you're banned forever with no recourse.
RT @JohnSwanYT : @TwitterSupport stays silent on this issue no matter how many times you try and bring it up. There is a serious issue with Twitter's DMCA implementation that I plan to make light of in a video coming soon.
RT @JohnSwanYT : .@nicholasdeorio was just banned on Twitter due to a mass of DMCA takedowns. These takedowns were submitted by an individual that did not own the rights to the content being posted, and has been impersonating companies and other creators for months.

"@SlushTV_ @Technicals_ @thekinocorner I don't think he hasn't gotten shit for this, but people can't help but laugh at Frank's dedication to get the worst of Boogie, even if it cost him his life it seems.

"@Technicals_ Exactly.
Short of Frank getting seriously hurt when putting himself in lethal danger is a moment worthy of a Darwin Award, but fortunately he doesn't get the trophy.
Boogie failing to learn not to play into trolls is exactly what lead to this leaving the internet.
Hard way it is."
"@Technicals_ Let it be known Frank's a POS. Even if he can be funny or shameless, I don't think what he did was right to Boogie; however, Boogie ain't a smart man either.

@AnthonyHack17 A copyright strike is a copyright strike, not for taking down videos, even slanderous ones. And what Cobra did (joke about Destiny being a pedo) is pretty shitty but Destiny can absolutely be criticised for going way over the top on a dumb kid to insane levels.
@AnthonyHack17 JD falsely copyright striked a LtCobra video and sent him a fake cease-and-desist letter to intimidate him. He did do stuff wrong. But that doesn't negate anything Keemstar did.
"It seems like this community can't understand when two people who have beef w/each other are both bad.
Keemstar and h3h3 are both bad
Destiny and Keemstar both fucked up in 2019
When these sorts of drama happen, you have people attacking one or attacking the other. Why not both?"
@dutchplacehold1 I don't think anyone has been doing that.
@nicholasdeorio H3 thinks his fans are dumb enough to believe his utter bullshit and it turns out they are.
@IceageInACan I don't follow sports
@CommentCoppedd The other cake videos
@HarleyTBSYT Yeah, why care about an idiot asshole's opinion.
"Keemstar has deleted about half of his 2016 videos
Most of Pyro's old videos are muted for copyright reasons
Leafy's channel is terminated
Leafy Content Cop was removed
A lot of Filthy Frank's content has been removed

YouTube is exterminating its old self."

@BasedSerbian @jadeechonnart my attempt 
@BasedSerbian @jadeechonnart I can do a pretty good impression of him too, in fact i may voice this out lol
And they go after him again and again and he keeps winning, that's what I like, a winner. The democrats stole the election from me but I won it, I won it 3 times, every time, that's why I win, he wins okay. It's called IQ and I have it and Keemstar has it, you can't stop us! 
@jadeechonnart Of course I'm okay! I am, mark my words, the most okay person in the entire world, no one has ever been as okay as me. People call me up they say "Donnie, why- how are you so okay?", and I say, I say it's just genes, its called being a winner, because that's what I am, a winner. 
@blaretelevision I've memorized it enough where I can mimic his speaking style.
And people, total frauds, are making up total and complete lies about him, its the truth folks. One loser, Ethan I think, Evil Ethan, promoting terrible people, the worst. Shows the sort of people against him, we love Keemstar, don't we? They won't stop the lies, they're scared. 
"Keemstar folks, Killer Keemstar, a tremendous guy! Everyone says he's the best at reporting the news okay? Real news not fake news like CNN and the radical left. Total fake. Not him, the fake news, the democrats.
He's even got 5 million subscribers, huge, bigger than Sleepy Joe. "
@blaretelevision @Bowblax
@JediNabber Not sure. YouTubers are idiots, but so are most politicians.
@HarleyTBSYT Yeah, having a channel with 10k subs where people watch whatever you post is better imo than a channel with 100k subs where people will only watch you if you upload a specific thing.

@WackyBruhTV @h3h3productions @YouTube I'm not so sure about using off-platform behavior to justify on-platform demonetization/censorship.

@BrizanOnYoutube I'm just trying to explain it so people can understand
@TommyNC2010 I do agree with you. I was just thinking in the pragmatic sense what would be best, but morally, he 100% owes you massively.
@Vampuffin @jadeechonn I'm Australian so idk how they do it in Eastern Europe or wherever you're from. But over here coefficients are treated as separate from normal multiplication.
@TommyNC2010 Tommy you are too good for Ethan, at this point his reputation's so destroyed perhaps associating with him would do more negatives lol. Good for you that you've kept up making content.
@jadeechonn 2(3) is not 2*3. Coefficients are done before divisions, just like squaring.
"@Vampuffin Coefficient is done before the division. So the division is after multiplying the (1+2) by 2.
The coefficient (the first 2) acts as a bracket in a sense. That is how the order of the operations is done.
2*2 is not 2(2)."
"This can be written as 6/(2(1+2)), as the coefficient (the first 2) comes right after brackets in the order of operations and as such can be expressed in that form.
According to the order of operations, brackets come first, so:
6/(2(3))
6/(6)
Then the final division:
6/6 = 1 "

Apparently according to topic commentators, you can't be criticized for clickbait if you get views.
a story in 4 parts... 
@JohnSwanling @DavidplexTalks You didn't exaggerate the title/thumbnail, you just straight up lied lmao
"@JohnSwanling @DavidplexTalks Mr Beast or PewDiePie never said they died in the thumbnail and then in the video their alive.
That's more like Jaystation lol"
"@JohnSwanling @DavidplexTalks Well he didn't die. The title and thumbnail make people click on it because it makes people think he died. Correct?
Then they click on the video and you say he didn't die. That's clickbait."
@JohnSwanling @DavidplexTalks yeah so its clickbait, the title says something different from the video itself to attract more clicks
@_AlexTheLoser_ üíôso proud of you
@JohnSwanling Nope. This generation of people getting offended is the same generation who watched PewDiePie and FilthyFrank. If MrBeast doesn't apologize for edgy jokes from 5 years ago, he won't lose ANY viewers.
@JohnSwanling In 2018 (after demonetization) PewDiePie was pretty edgy still and media hit pieces were made on him all the time and he responded in the best way, by not apologizing for edgy jokes, which is what Mr Beast and other channels now should do.
@JohnSwanling Youtube hasn't demonetized a whole channel for just normal-level "edginess". Crowder and Shane went further than most and those are the only examples I can think of.
"@JohnSwanling Demonetization started being a large issue in 2017, the same year that Filthy Frank left. PewDiePie dropped the edginess in early 2018, Ethan started focusing on the podcast and stopped being edgy in 2018.
People have been edgy way after this."
"@JohnSwanling Twitter and Youtube haven't banned edgy humor (Youtube has banned the REAL edgy stuff tho).
Censorship didn't birth cancel culture, the new generation of youtubers who will bow down to the army of stans did. They normalized blandness."
@JohnSwanling just say 'retard' nigga its not that hard lmao
@JohnSwanling idk about this specific instance, but I think that no one would get cancelled if they didn't try to hide/apologize for edginess
@JohnSwanling Also I was meaning twitter cancelled, so PewDiePie (who was cancelled by the media and Mumkey/Leafy/Crowder (who were kicked by Youtube themselves) don't count. I guess you could make an argument for Shane.
@JohnSwanling If all the youtubers getting 'cancelled' just said "fuck off, I made edgy jokes, deal with it", then the culture of cancelling wouldn't be around.
@JohnSwanling which youtuber's income and life was threatened due to making edgy jokes

"@BasedAreZee The biggest problem I had with John is he is too protective over his reputation. He basically got his wish of returning with a second chance, basically no one called him out.

gotta say, like them or not @KEEMSTAR, @KavosYT, @YoTommyC @WillyMacShow and @CCrowe90 excel in this department, even if I disagree with them sometimes, I admire their honesty
The most important thing to a commentator in my opinion (apart from their ability to be entertaining) is their courage to stand up for what they believe, no matter how unpopular their opinion is or how much hate they get.
@PogSwan Judging how to live your life off youtubers is a bad idea, but a a good youtuber can be a good role model in aspects. Youtubers are just like anyone else after all, and any good person, regardless of career is someone to look up to.

@smeef_ @DoktorSkippy @Lilmaneyt I made the iceberg, announced the video on twitter and politely asked skipper to just delay the video a bit. I don't think that's unreasonable.
@smeef_ @DoktorSkippy @Lilmaneyt I posted it on the subreddit because I'm a fan of the subreddit and thought people would enjoy it.
@BrizanOnYoutube @DoktorSkippy @Lilmaneyt Because I'm a fan of that subreddit and I posted it for... get this, people to enjoy.
@BrizanOnYoutube @DoktorSkippy @Lilmaneyt I posted it because I thought people would like to see it. I said on Twitter I was making a video.
@KrzearYT Maybe it was a mistake for me to do that, but whoever stealing the idea can still be criticized as well.
@DoktorSkippy I wasn't leaving out DMs on purpose to try and hide stuff lol, they just didn't really add anything that was important that I felt the need to post.
@DoktorSkippy @Lilmaneyt Maybe instead of vaguely saying nothing in DMs, you could commit to your "nice guy" persona and hold off on the vid like I asked. I still think it was a dick move.
@DoktorSkippy @Lilmaneyt I don't there's a point in "crediting me" if I asked you to delay the video and you didn'tü§∑. Anyway, obviously you, having a channel 20x mine making a video on the exact same chart I made, will stunt the views of my video.
@Ursakastann Exact same
@Arlus He hadn't done much on the video yet, I told him as soon as I found out he was making the video and I asked specifically to delay the video based around my iceberg chart until my video was out
@Arlus I announced I was making a video on it on my twitter, and even if he didn't see it, weeks ago I asked him politely to just delay the video a while, which he vaguely seemed to accept.
@VleasoTV @TheTurnz_ I also posted it to twitter earlier announcing I was making a video on it.
@TheTurnz_ I made the actual original iceberg chart myself and I made it clear in DMs weeks ago that I was putting a lot of effort into it and I would appreciate it if he delayed his vid a bit.
@TheTurnz_ I literally made the iceberg chart his entire video is based off. I think I have some rights here, I didn't just "claim" the topic.
@BrizanOnYoutube I said on Twitter that I would be making a video on it. Weeks ago I asked him if he could delay it until after mine and he said "my bad".
@gayplant101 He's known for weeks. He said "my bad".
@Distronical I made the original iceberg chart and as he has a much bigger channel, it would overshadow any video I would make on the same subject, stunting the video's views.
@Adog00YouTube He's known for weeks now since I told him in DMs.
@radmaniiac I told him in DMs weeks ago.
I told him a week ago to just delay the video until after my one (which I announced earlier and made the original iceberg chart on reddit) since he has a larger channel and the video would overshadow mine, and he said "my bad". Then why is he still uploading it now???

@acidmais @Bean_Machine420 @JustKyya I can say it and I will, I genuinely dislike people who are in it just for the money/views. If you make money/views while making content you believe is good quality, that's great! But people whose main goal is as much money/views as possible are shit.

@Bean_Machine420 @acidmais @JustKyya It's not all about the views and subscribers, otherwise make toy elsa unboxing videos, it'll get even more views than any commentary could.
@acidmais @JustKyya Yes, editing is overrated anyway, personality is everything
@acidmais @JustKyya I agree, I think people who get upset at anyone who makes Vegan Teacher/Pokimane/Dream videos are stupid because some are genuinely entertaining.
@acidmais @JustKyya I'm not saying you are one of those people, but all I'm saying is if a creator knowingly makes bad content just because it gets them views, they don't deserve respect.
@acidmais @JustKyya Although I do find many topic commentators to not be entertaining at all (rather using trend hopping for success), I do agree that it is one of the fastest ways to grow. However any creators that take that path shouldn't expect respect when they blatantly take that path.
"@acidmais @JustKyya People have tried new things and if its an interesting, original idea, it works. It's not like anything apart from a Dream/Vegan Teacher video is destined to fail.
Also, not everything's about how to get the most subs."

@Rainyoffline @StellaVindicta @VleasoTV @Neoncaffeine @Distronical @OhMarDayz @AidinTLC @RadManiac @arztalks @TheTurnz_ @JohnSwanYT @GeneralHayley @imallexxstan69 I wasn't. I joked around in the same manner that other people did
@AidinTLC @Rainyoffline I never had feelings for her either
@OhMarDayz @Neoncaffeine @AidinTLC @StellaVindicta @VleasoTV @RadManiac @arztalks @TheTurnz_ @JohnSwanYT @GeneralHayley @imallexxstan69 I agree
@AidinTLC @OhMarDayz @StellaVindicta @VleasoTV @RadManiac @arztalks @TheTurnz_ @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @GeneralHayley @imallexxstan69 I agree. Everyone didn't want her in there. But some people a FEW times did say some sexual stuff to her.
"@TheTurnz_ @OhMarDayz @StellaVindicta @VleasoTV @AidinTLC @RadManiac @arztalks @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @GeneralHayley @imallexxstan69 1. I never said it was okay
2. I barely even flirted with her most times I told her to stop being weird"
@Rainyoffline *cough*Aidin**cough*Krazzf*
@Rainyoffline Show proof I flirted with her in dms.
@OhMarDayz @AidinTLC @StellaVindicta @VleasoTV @RadManiac @arztalks @TheTurnz_ @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @GeneralHayley @imallexxstan69 SAME AS ME, I didn't even really say anything to her and I admitted it was weird and I even kicked her out sometimes
@OhMarDayz @StellaVindicta @VleasoTV @AidinTLC @RadManiac @arztalks @TheTurnz_ @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @GeneralHayley @imallexxstan69 I barely even flirted with her, I didn't do nearly as much as others did. There was a few remarks here and there but that was it. Other people 100% said some sexual things to her. If you are denying that you are in denial
@Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @VleasoTV @AidinTLC @RadManiac @arztalks @TheTurnz_ @JohnSwanYT @GeneralHayley @imallexxstan69 Like I said, most people didn't. But some did and I can't remember exactly who
@StellaVindicta @Neoncaffeine @VleasoTV @AidinTLC @RadManiac @arztalks @TheTurnz_ @JohnSwanYT @GeneralHayley @imallexxstan69 @KSI @Dream lol people just added them because their dms are open
@Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @VleasoTV @AidinTLC @RadManiac @arztalks @TheTurnz_ @JohnSwanYT @GeneralHayley @imallexxstan69 I can't remember who exactly in the gc was flirting with her, but here is the list of all the members of the group chat. 
@StellaVindicta @VleasoTV @AidinTLC @RadManiac @arztalks @TheTurnz_ @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @GeneralHayley @imallexxstan69 SO MANY people did. Like I said it was generally thought (apart from close friends like AidinTLC) that she was 13, as she tweeted that she was 13 and posted in the group chat she was 13 multiple times.
@TheTurnz_ @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @GeneralHayley @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 What I meant was everyone thought she was 13 even though she was 12.
@Neoncaffeine @Distronical @JohnSwanYT @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I'll obviously censor that out
RT @slazo : 
@Neoncaffeine @Distronical @JohnSwanYT @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I'll take a picture of the actual document soon :)
@Distronical @Neoncaffeine @JohnSwanYT @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 Nah I actually got a real IQ test done. Like a legit one
@LmmSkits hi
@SisterZio Normal, in fact its normal to get depressed whenever.
@StellaVindicta @inversedaniel @nicktheoreo I agree. I know now to never converse in an even joking flirting way ever again
@StellaVindicta @BillBaines_ @JadaTheDemon @realExate @hannah_animal @zoggyt I will take a break off the internet. I can't tell my parents about this for... reasons, but I will have a long break from the community (apart from talking with some friends on discord)
@StellaVindicta Multiple of us blocked her after she said that, (because we realized we had been talking weirdly with a 12-year-old) so she left almost immediately.
@StellaVindicta @JadaTheDemon @realExate @hannah_animal @zoggyt I realized its wrong though, I even said in that DM that I felt disgusted by those conversations. I said multiple times this stuff would never happen again.
@StellaVindicta It didn't. All the joke flirts were in the group DM ( you can ask the people in the group DM how they were)
@StellaVindicta Flirting was in group DMs as well as public tweets
@mythichorse @D1GITALM0SHPIT
@StellaVindicta @Quickmaths22is4 @Neoncaffeine @imallexxstan69 I agree, criticism is not bullying
@StellaVindicta @zoggyt @realExate @JadaTheDemon I unblocked her during this drama because I wanted to clear my name. Also what she says 'yea' to is true
@zoggyt @StellaVindicta @realExate @JadaTheDemon Yes I did know then, that was right after I found out. I blocked her immediately afterwards.
"@StellaVindicta @zoggyt @hannah_animal @CordWit @Sub2Michae1 @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @imallexxstan69 Well no matter what I do, even if I 'earn' it, everyone will still want me out of the community
But I will try anyways"
@StellaVindicta @zoggyt @hannah_animal @CordWit @Sub2Michae1 @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @imallexxstan69 I agree with this. But I have a feeling that most people will never forgive me.
@zoggyt @hannah_animal @CordWit @Sub2Michae1 @StellaVindicta @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @imallexxstan69 Let me be clearer. How can I rectify things and rejoin the community?

@Weezis3 My full response is coming tomorrow
@AnthonyRaaaaaaa So no one should wait for my side???
@Sub2Michae1 @CordWit @StellaVindicta @zoggyt @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @imallexxstan69 I have reflected. I know it's wrong and it won't happen again. My parents would fucking kill me if they found out any of this and my only friends are youtubers on twitter.
@zoggyt @StellaVindicta @CordWit @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @imallexxstan69 Nothing like that will ever happen again. If nothing like that happens again what's the problem???
@CordWit @StellaVindicta @zoggyt @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @imallexxstan69 I don't need help. This stuff will never happen again and I don't need my fucking parents to monitor my account. I just want this whole situation to disappear and everything to get back to normal.
@zoggyt @StellaVindicta @CordWit @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @imallexxstan69 I don't even think I was aroused by that 12 year old. I wasn't in my right mind when I said that
@StellaVindicta @zoggyt @CordWit @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @imallexxstan69 I will never become one.
@CordWit @zoggyt @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I recognize it's a mistake and it will NEVER happen again, nothing even like it. I don't understand why people won't give me a second chance.
@zoggyt @CordWit @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I AM NOT A PEDOPHILE
@zoggyt @StellaVindicta @CordWit @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @imallexxstan69 It was one stupid mistake and it will never happen again. I deserve another chance.
@zoggyt @CordWit @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I don't even know if I was aroused by that. And even if I was why should I deactivate over something where if I was, I would have no control over.

"@zoggyt @CordWit @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I honestly don't know, I don't know what I meant then but I am certainly not attracted to her.
In fact I blocked her right after that DM and said that I was disgusted by that stuff."

@JohnSwanYT @dominosPZAZ5 @Neoncaffeine @GeneralHayley @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I do not remember EVER hearing her real age. There are even tweets (her account is now deleted) of her saying she is 13
@JadynIsBanned I did
@JohnSwanYT @_Davidplex @Neoncaffeine @GeneralHayley @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 You heavily insinuated it.
@Sub2Michae1 @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @GeneralHayley @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I'm not a pedo and I stand by that. I will tell the whole story tomorrow in a docs/twitlonger.
@Neoncaffeine No one knew she was 12
@JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @GeneralHayley @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 She said she was 13.
"@StellaVindicta Yes, I lied but I'm telling the whole truth now. I do NOT find 12-year-olds attractive, I said something dumb that I didn't mean.
Like I said, I will respond in full tomorrow"
@Neoncaffeine @JohnSwanYT @GeneralHayley @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 No one knew she was 12 and when they did everyone (including me) blocked her.
@JohnSwanYT @GeneralHayley @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 Half the small commentary community was flirting with her.
@StellaVindicta @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @AidinTLC @imallexxstan69 I know, I never said I didn't. But I am NOT a pedophile.
@Neoncaffeine @JohnSwanYT @StellaVindicta @AidinTLC @imallexxstan69 I agree, it is weird. But not pedo.
@JohnSwanYT @StellaVindicta @Neoncaffeine @AidinTLC @imallexxstan69 You're right. I fucked up. Big time.
@Neoncaffeine @JohnSwanYT @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 No, I said I was disgusted and turned on at the same time.
@JohnSwanYT @StellaVindicta @Neoncaffeine @AidinTLC @imallexxstan69 Yes, 13 isn't that bad for me, i'm 15.
@Neoncaffeine Wrong. I didn't try to get with her. I blocked her after the DM.
@JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I didn't mean what I said. I'm not attracted to kids. Once I found out her age I told her I'm disgusted that I flirted with her before and I blocked her. You can dm her to confirm it if you want
@Neoncaffeine @JohnSwanYT @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I'm not. I didn't mean what I said.
@StellaVindicta @Neoncaffeine @AidinTLC @JohnSwanYT @imallexxstan69 Yes but I didn't know her age before. He did.
@JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 Shouldn't people get second chances?
@Neoncaffeine @JohnSwanYT @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 No, I don't know why I said it but I promise I am not into kids
@StellaVindicta @Neoncaffeine @AidinTLC @JohnSwanYT @imallexxstan69 
@JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 IDK I was probably just saying some stupid shit. My bad.
@Neoncaffeine @JohnSwanYT @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I didn't mean that
@StellaVindicta @Neoncaffeine @AidinTLC @JohnSwanYT @imallexxstan69 Then he's lying, I didn't know her age before then. It's in he fucking group chat
@JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I didn't mean what I said. I'm not turned on by children.
@StellaVindicta @Neoncaffeine @AidinTLC @JohnSwanYT @imallexxstan69 ???? I didn't. DM me that proof. I had NO idea.
@JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 How can I control that??? The best thing I could have doen in the situation was block her and that's what I did.
@Neoncaffeine @JohnSwanYT @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I never said I want to get with a 12 year old
@JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 Well no but it was an accident for me to tell her that.
@Neoncaffeine @JohnSwanYT @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 Yeah that was wrong and I shouldn't have said that. However immediately after sending that DM I blocked her.
@JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 That was an accident, yes it's wrong but I see no reason to leave the community. I blocked her immediately after this and I won't do anymore of this sort of shit again.
@Neoncaffeine @JohnSwanYT @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 Like I said I had no idea she was 12
@JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I didn't know she was 12 before this. Once I found out I DMd her that and said we would not talk anymore and I blocked her.
@Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I didn't know she was 12 lol. She flirted with half of the commentary community (including people over 18).

@arztalks Jan 2017 + 4 = Jan 2021 - 0.2 = Nov 2020
hopefully out next week
@arztalks No, almost 4. I took 3.8 years to make it, so almost 4.
no more 2 hour long videos 
took almost 4 years to make a vid 
@arztalks i mean idk lol but Zoid and ImVerge are 12 rn
@arztalks half the commentary community made commentary since they were 12
I made some fucking good maps of a Minecraft server I played in back then too  
@ban_lt one post when i was 11 lol
@viewer_2 was
people are really making commentary videos at age 12 lol when I was 12 I was posting spaghet and logan paul memes on r/pewdiepiesubmissions
@ban_lt @2_romann Yeah can't believe he's a year younger than you
@ban_lt @2_romann He's not. And he just turned 13 a few months ago.
@ban_lt @2_romann himself
I had no idea @2_romann was only 13
@TheTwoon @ban_lt @drdestiny ignore @ban_lt, he's a troll
@RatedUnrated @KrzearYT @SensitiveSoci3t But the majority of TTS creators don't do it because of speech impediments or muteness or such
@RatedUnrated @KrzearYT @SensitiveSoci3t This is criticism, not discrimination, they can change their content to be better. You can't say "well just don't watch it" when it is a legitimate argument.
@KrzearYT @RatedUnrated @SensitiveSoci3t Exactly, no one in their right mind would think all those reddit channels are mutes
@RatedUnrated @KrzearYT @SensitiveSoci3t wtf, I don't know what this has to do with what he said
Thank you @_Davidplex for the great new banner!
RT @KrzearYT : @SensitiveSoci3t I don't care how much effort you put in a video, if you use text-to-speech instead of your actual voice, you'll never be considered a content creator in my eyes
@imallexxstan69 can't, it won't allow me to
@imallexxstan69 ???

I want to go on someone's podcast
I'm never making another video essay again
@imallexxstan69 what's so yikes? It's not in a sexual way or anything lol
@imallexxstan69 Yes, its just cute watching my friends' videos from when they were 10 and 11.
@Twizz_Fizz cursed
Honestly, I love watching my friends' commentary videos from like 2 years ago and listening to their cute high-pitched voices. It's so cute.
"I know quite a lot of people have been asking to be in my next video, but sorry the next video is going to be a pretty small video so not really a collab.
The only person involved will be @ZoidxFox to edit it."
@AidinTLC eh I'm not the biggest fan of TRO but yeah the others are incredible
@imallexxstan69 Maybe you should make some friends instead of weirding everyone out all the time.
@OhMarDayz BWC is Aussie. James Marriott and WillNE make shit content.
@imallexxstan69 That sounds more like friendship, which is a better thing
@WhalezYT 9/11
@imallexxstan69 cursed
@JohnSwanYT @AugieRFC tommy c was right, children should leave the internet...
@zoggyt The curse of commentary
@MrBeastYT @AugieRFC
British commentators are either one of the best or one of the worst
Imagine if Jake Paul didn't have his name shortened and his name was 'Jacob Paul'. That would be weird.
@Krazzf women are pregnant
@Krazzf Yeah, I'm a WAP (West Anglican Protestant)
@The_Coom_Slayer I hate bad characters, male or female. These are bad characters.
@ilymais I don't even know which type of people this post is meant for...
Woo yeah baby! That's what I've been waiting for
@MrMicrowave_exe video
*1.3k
thanks for the 1.3 views my guys! 
@VleasoTV Michae1 checked (soon after it was uploaded though) and the same results came up so idk
@BillBaines_ @JohnSwanYT This is why John Swan wants to keep Section 230
i don't really understand but i agree 
Now I have a reason to go on the commentary tier lists
While I am happy to see the positive reaction to my video, I am incredibly grateful to all the people who have criticized the video, especially some larger commentators. It is impossible to improve without recognizing your mistakes or where you can do better after all.
RT @actuallyQwack : @_ThePieman_ 
@Distronical I'm not making any more videos similar to this one
@Bowblax @XanderhalTV We got far-left, centre-left, centre-right, we just need a far-right person to be the 4th host.
@Distronical you'll have to wait and see
@inversedaniel @AugieRFC I think Augie is too careful to be considered a rapist, even by Xanderhal. He makes sure to keep at least 10 meters away from women at all times.
If my video gets 10k views, I will tweet the URLs of all the cringy meme videos I made years back.
@DrChris_PhD That really cleared things up. Thank you, Twitter!
@Database1337 Yeah, I don't expect most people to watch the whole video lol. And thanks, your words mean a lot.
@aid8nn To get to 100 likes quicker to post the tweet.
@Database1337 No, you seriously make banger videos. I always stop whatever I'm doing to watch your video whenever you upload.
@Database1337 But you make videos with the quality of a 100k sub commentator
ok this is epic 
@Rainyoffline Some commentators just got out of primary school.
@StellaVindicta True, but 4th for Colossal Is Crazy is just strange (or crazy). After looking at analytics an unusually large portion of the views is coming from search so the video must do extremely well in search.
This is REAL lmao
@WhalezYT I don't know what a 12-year-old (guessing from the picture) can expect to happen if he decides to e-dte.
"Wow, on incognito my video comes up 4th for 'LtCorbis', 5th for 'Soph' and 5th for fucking 'Colossal Is Crazy'.
My video is either doing really well in search results or my incognito mode is broken (possibly the latter lol). "
@Saucy__Jack I think Pieman has been on a downward spiral mentally and now he's lost it completely
6 away from not being a 100 sub commentator anymore 
@gamertrash14 not too long, couple weeks tops
Now I am officially a youtuber
@AidinTLC lol I was at 147 subs 8 hours ago
lol i'm getting all these discord friend requests from random people. My discord DMs are open, but I only friend actual friends on discord.
@imallexxstan69 How old is Zoid again?
@Saucy__Jack I'm not sure about that but I sure hope so!
@Saucy__Jack Thanks! While the editing (both visual and audio) is not the best, I am genuinely proud of the writing and research put into the video. Glad you liked it.
For anyone wanting the list of music used in my latest video: 
@ZoidxFox @darthfader27 what happened?
"I actually came close to interviewing @sewernugget for my video but she declined at the last minute. Anytime she or Victor wants to agree to an interview, I‚Äôm down.
Also, I would love to see her do a live reaction to the full thing."
Slightly edited title to add [LtCorbis] so people searching for 'LtCorbis' will come up with my video because that is very specific to her whereas 'Soph' reveals a bunch of other channels and stuff unrelated.
"@AspergersFox The video is a homage.
And no there is literally no better channel than his."
I'm glad YouTube removed over 20 dislikes from my video, maybe the dislikes were an error or some sort of raid but thanks @TeamYouTube

@KatszeH I disagree, I really like the music choices and I used some different ones he didn't use
Lol obviously the video is very similar to EmpLemon. It's a homage, just like what JustJargon did with Down The Rabbit Hole.
@OGEPIC1 homage!

@dominosPZAZ5 @arztalks Because the hosts are pretty small channels.
@dominosPZAZ5 @arztalks Sorry I was wrong about the sub-level. But they only had 37 episodes (not counting reunions) and my point stands anyway, that 100 subs are not that much and you don't need Baited-level entertainment for it.
RT @jordylancaster : ‚Äúi usually like your tweets, but you posted one opinion that i disagree with. unfollowed.‚Äù 
@dominosPZAZ5 @arztalks lol Baited had like 30 episodes and a million subs, I don't think you need to be as entertaining as them to have 100 subs
@CNN @angeladewan Next time do a little research. Erdogan isn't a "populist", he is just a right-wing dictator. I understand that right-wing populists usually have a degree of authoritarianism but connecting Erdogan as a populist is dishonest.

I didnt really do anything that wrong or to attack/hurt people, however I have noticed that (to no intention of the big commentators making their tweets) I am being treated more harshly and less jokingly than I believe I deserve. Again, make fun of me. But I deserve some respect.
Look, I'm fine with, in fact I even enjoy being made fun of and teased and I have no problem with people unfollowing me. But having some cringe tweets and being awkward around women does not mean I should be treated as a pariah on the levels of Raintism or Shive.
"@loafyxo Look, I don't want to converse with you anymore because you threw around the most insane accusations towards me, and anyone who looks through the conversation we had can see it. Now you are changing the conversation.

@loafyxo Also, you are literally insane. You accused me of using my fanbase to harass you and John Swan and that I am being an abuser who lies and gaslights.

@TheTurnz_ @AllucidLol @DaceptYT @rythril Allucid was wrong to assume for no reason that Turnz liked Raintism, but I think what he was trying to say is that he would prefer to keep that e-dating stuff private now. Bringin up something he would like private is different from making fun of a close friend.
@AllucidLol @TheTurnz_ @DaceptYT @rythril Turnz isn't even friends with that weirdo Raintism

"@TPuppetOG @JohnSwanYT @EmperorLemon You clearly miss the point of everything I say and are going in circles so I think I'll leave it here.
Thank you for your time and I hope I cleared up some misconceptions :)"
Why is @Sub2Michae1 in here 
"@TPuppetOG @JohnSwanYT @EmperorLemon I was the subject of your 'critique' and as such I have a right to defend myself against such baseless accusations, it is not harassment.
And as I said before, John quote tweeted me and you don't seem to have a problem with that?"
"@TPuppetOG @JohnSwanYT @EmperorLemon I am saying that John Swan quoted me and you don't seem to have a problem with that.
I didn't go 'out of my way' to harass you, I replied to a few comments and I replied to you to clear up what I thought was a misunderstanding.

Who's screeching now?"
@TPuppetOG Oh my, heavens I'm so scared
@TPuppetOG What in that exact tweet is incorrect? You said I was using 'pointless emojis', which is not true, sure you may disagree with the usage of them but they are not 'pointless'.
@TPuppetOG @JohnSwanYT @EmperorLemon Quote tweeting is a part of twitter. John Swan quote tweeted me. Also, I don't think I made any snide remarks.
Apparently, me and my 300 followers are harassing you and John Swan, who has over 20 thousand followers. Also practically no one has even liked, tweeted about or replied to this conversation so I don't see any harassment. 
"@TPuppetOG @JohnSwanYT @EmperorLemon on me aren't really things I can respond to such as my tweets being unfunny or cringe (subjective things).
Also, I don't think I am screeching or such given as I have been much more polite in this discussion and unlike you have not resorted to personal attacks once.
(2/2)"
"@TPuppetOG @JohnSwanYT @EmperorLemon Humor is subjective after all, but I thought the funny part was the referencing of it, as in like memes reference things and the reference itself is the joke.
I am clearly taking criticism, I am responding to most points about me after all, and most tweets clowning (1/2)"
@C0nT3nTl3af yes, tomorrow
"@TPuppetOG This point?
"
"@TPuppetOG Oh and also you haven't even tried to defend your original tweet which was completely incorrect, rather diverting topics.
"
@TPuppetOG @JohnSwanYT @EmperorLemon Here's Cambridge's definition of a parody. Something can surely be both a parody and homage. 
@TPuppetOG Your original 'analysis' was that I used 'pointless emojis' and that I was like a '12 year old who just learned how to make ASCII dicks'. I don't see how any of our further discussion proved your point or in fact had anything relating to it.
@TPuppetOG I can, however, I don't go browsing through someone's bio before deciding to reply to them on twitter.
@TPuppetOG @JohnSwanYT @EmperorLemon How am I a "psuedo-intellectual"? I was not being unoriginal by copying him, I was paying homage to him as I clearly see him as a large influence on my style of content. Also how am I immature again? What, I made some unfunny or cringe tweets, so what? Everyone has before!
@Sub2Michae1 @LtCythix May 9, how long ago was that again? 
@Timelog123 @aid8nn It clearly says 65
@Sub2Michae1 @aid8nn did he really lol?
Also, he can't make the argument that 'any emojis are bad' because he also has some in his handle also happening to reference a channel, although in an even less obvious way
'pointless emojis'  
@TPuppetOG @JohnSwanYT @EmperorLemon What makes you think that? Anyways your original tweet that was supposed to "destroy" me has been debunked so this is obviously you changing the discussion point.
@em_dee_ess @JohnSwanYT unironically thanks for the criticism, my tweet was just me practising my swan impression, wasn't meant to be 'funny' or anything. I will follow your advice :)
@NJtrashboys @JohnSwanYT ???
@inversedaniel @JohnSwanYT @tommycsftp get on this
@TPuppetOG @JohnSwanYT If you couldn't tell the 'emojis' are parodying popular commentary YouTuber @EmperorLemon's Twitter handle.
@jadeechonn My impression of him.
@jadeechonn It wasn't supposed to be 'funny' though that's the point I'm trying to make.
@Dino__lol @LtCythix @JohnSwanYT And also the fact that he is much better than me
@jadeechonn Exactly, and if you looked at my tweet for more than a second you could tell it wasn't some attack at Swan as many assume but me doing an impression of him as I like doing impressions of commentators.

@OGEPIC1 Not just that, small commentators are mentioned, tweeted about and doing collabs with some of the biggest commentators.
@BdankYT @Krazzf yes, even though from now on he can't use it 2-3-4 in the morning
There is no other community on YouTube that has this much connection between creators this small and large, none at all, which is part of what makes this community great. 
@imallexxstan69 ? what is a spaz
This is a good thing btw, this allows for small commentators to grow much easier than in previous years and fosters (mostly) growth among commentators big and small.
Even if it is mostly negative, 2020 has revolutionized the commentary community in a way that small 500 sub commentators like Krazzf get talked about by the biggest commentators like Keemstar. Commentary has truly become ONE community.

@LtCythix @TheTurnz_ This actually really helps out with the algorithm so you really did him a favor
Fake Grade video I was in the process of making. Gave up when I realized I couldn't draw lol 
Agree 100%, I don't understand their logic at all. 
@LtCythix so does shane dawson
@Database1337 I always thought 'pogscast' would sound better though, like the yogscast
@Database1337 I'm joking about this btw, your podcast is way better and it deserves more subs and views.
@RSTYCG double cringe
RT @RSTYCG : @_ThePieman_ 
@RSTYCG I can't believe Kermit the frog would say this
I'm friends with @Noxlish1 but this is a really cringe take 
"@MrMicrowave_exe hey Vsauce, Michael here. MrMicrowave wants people to tell him facts.
... but what is a fact? (Vsauce music plays)"
@ZoidxFox @Krazzf @LtCythix Cythix can go on any time he wants
HASAN 
@autismo_YT2 @Krazzf we'll see
Everyone help @YouTube_BriZ, YouTube is fucking him over and he needs as much support from as many people as he can. 
Tomorrow after school @Krazzf is gonna wake up with 5K+ notifications lol
tbh they would be way ahead if they uploaded more lol
@DaceptYT no
@RealBWC What is it mr bwc?
"Dread it, run from it, destiny arrives all the same" 
 
@KyleKulinski i agree
RT @_ThePieman_ : Gonna try to get @Krazzf on the Drama Time podcast this weekend
@munke97244693 I'm saying why can they do it and not me?
@BdankYT @Krazzf I mean you're basically part of the "Drama Time Crew" or whatever, people who always are put on, like how Augie always has a few people who go on every stream.
@munke97244693 Large commentators speak of small commentators way worse than I do.
@munke97244693 I'm not acting like I'm better than them, I'm criticizing how cringy their content is. And if everyone is cringy in some way, who can do that then?
@munke97244693 Everyone is cringe in a different way. Just most aren't honest about revealing it.
@munke97244693 Yeah its a bit cringe but it's a question I was asked and I answered honestly. I still think its nowhere as cringe as some other commentator's content. Also I can make fun of them while being a bit cringe myself, everyone as something cringe about them.
Gonna try to get @Krazzf on the Drama Time podcast this weekend
@munke97244693 So I'm very awkward around girls. Why are so many people angry about me for it? People saying how I'm just a cringe commentator now and that I've "fallen from grace". Yeah it's kinda cringe but it's not very unusual for a teenager.
Why am I even on these lists? I have no videos and somehow I get a B. At least put me in 'F' for my upload schedule and cringy tweets. 
@DeadMemeFrog @zoggyt @AllucidLol @Adog00YT @YouTube_BriZ At least when I go on your podcast it'll be interesting
@munke97244693 I stand by my tweet. I don't think they are "shit takes" despite popular consensus.
@zoggyt @AllucidLol @Adog00YT @YouTube_BriZ How do I act like a small commentator? I very, very rarely start drama or "expose" people, yes I make cringe takes but everyone does even big commentators and I try not to get involved in unnecessary beef as small commentators so often do.
@AllucidLol @Adog00YT @YouTube_BriZ Part of it looks 360p because the source material was 360p. And like I said not just Leafy but some other big commentators too.
not changing profile picture for christmas
"@AllucidLol @Adog00YT @YouTube_BriZ No, I never said it does. However, I certainly have talked to quite a few big commentators before and I have connections. Also, I am very well known in the medium commentary community.
Besides, anyone can judge small commentators, even other small commentators."
@AllucidLol @Adog00YT @YouTube_BriZ I can show you the DMs lol
@AllucidLol @Adog00YT @YouTube_BriZ A video called "leafy clones", there are reuploads on youtube. Part of the video was based on my commentary chart I made and Leafy followed me to ask me to make a blank template for it.
@AllucidLol @Adog00YT @YouTube_BriZ Before he got terminated obviously.
@AllucidLol @Adog00YT @YouTube_BriZ I barely mention it! And he followed me because I helped him with a video.
@Vampuffin Would you like me to DM you the unlisted 2 hour long video which will be uploaded soon?
Send me the WORST commentary videos on the internet for me to react to.
@DaceptYT A lot of relevance within the community as well as common communication with much larger channels. I would consider people like @CordWit and @Database1337 large commentators despite their relatively low sub counts.
voter fraud 
@Adog00YT @DaceptYT yes that could count
@DaceptYT You can have under 10k subs and be not be a 'small commentator' but you have to have less than 10k subs to be a 'small commentator'.
my second video will be a commentary talking about and reacting to bad small commentators
@smartayylmao @PetersWRLD666 @BrizanOnYoutube smart smartyz

"Ok guys, who wants to go on the Drama Time podcast (me, @TheTurnz_, and @2_romann's podcast) next?
Or who do you want to go on?"
@TiredCast @MrMicrowave_exe thanks i guess?
LOOOL 
now that my first video is done, i'm working on my second 
@KeatonWalshYT i agree
@Rainyoffline Says the person who faked many heart attacks
@YouTube_BriZ I do
@BdankYT @YouTube_BriZ me too
@YouTube_BriZ being a big (20k subs) commentator doesn't get you anywhere in life either.
@YouTube_BriZ Like I said I don't think subscriber counts have to do with the definition of "big YouTuber", I think it has more to do with the connections you have in the community.
"RT @BdankYT : New video

We need to talk... (commentary community)

@YouTube_BriZ The boundary of small commentator has nothing to do with subs or views

@lottasin @ban_lt surprised there are only double more girls than non-binary
@Distronical @Adog00YT subs don't make a commentator big or small
@Adog00YT @Distronical not big, but not small
@Distronical Being a small youtuber has nothing to do with subs and views and all to do with relevance and ability to communicate with larger channels.
@AugieRFC let's go
@jgrms_ I don't care, its just funny watching people do it
@Distronical no
@nicholasdeorio @zaptiee @TheLordVega This is actually a good idea
I'm glad I'm not really in the "small commentary community", everyone in there is getting allegations and getting cancelled every day.

@lottasin nice
I would love a free-speech alternative to Twitter, but every time it seems like one pops up it turns out to just be the opposite of Twitter, banning anyone left-of-center and allowing and promoting any right-wing content. I just want an unbiased site where no one is banned.

@ilymais Maybe, but I'd put the estimate at &lt;1% of 15yo girls who wear makeup do it as a "creative outlet".
 
@ilymais How is putting some stuff on your face that makes you look different "expressing yourself"?
@ilymais I don't think the majority of them are using it to "express themselves". Most are using it to "make them look better" (which is a horrible mindset that has repercussions) or to attract attention from boys.
@ilymais Yes, they generally do, however they are not mentally mature for it and it generally has a negative effect on their mental health. The same goes for 15-year-olds.
@ilymais Should 5 year olds wear makeup?
The only sane answer. As in Family Guy and Rick and Morty. Unless you could separate seasons, then I would get rid of post-2000 Simpsons, but if not the classic episodes are too good to get rid of. 
@lottasin Too young
@StellaVindicta No lol. I'm a boy why would I wear makeup
@NotChrisPool I know, I'm just mentioning what the post said. While the majority of voters vote based on party lines (R and D), I think both Republicans and Democrats actually agree with their party's platform.
@BasedSerbian @Vampuffin @Bowblax bad take
"@BasedSerbian @Vampuffin @Bowblax I don't disagree necessarily. Either way,

‚ù§Ô∏è 
@Vampuffin @Bowblax what's wrong with geography &gt;:(
@imallexxstan69 would you say the same to 5 year olds? 15 year olds are not mature enough to have makeup
@imallexxstan69 disagree. 5 year olds and 15 year olds are more similar in mental capacity than 15 year olds and 25 year olds
@imallexxstan69 do you think 5 year olds should wear makeup?
"@imallexxstan69 makeup does not help with self-confidence it only makes them think they look bad.
Express yourself in a different way then, 15 is too young for that stuff"
@NotChrisPool Look, I don't like the democrats, but what if the democrats want higher taxes and no guns because of actual reasons, even if you disagree with them.
@imallexxstan69 wrong
If you are 15, there's no reason for you to have or wear makeup.

@AllucidLol It's a joke because it was something meant to be funny. I admitted I was being hyperbolic when I said 'cancelled' but what I meant was people calling me out.
Let's be honest. If @Leafy did this there would be a thousand comments calling him a comedic genius.
will change my name back in couple days probably
@JohnSwanYT @FBI wimmin
@AllucidLol Well, not "cancelled" really but first time being heavily criticised.
First time getting cancelled and I love it!
@DaceptYT @AllucidLol @yugaphobic 
@AllucidLol Nope. But lol so many people are triggered over what was a joke name.
Changed my name in memory of the greatest channel to ever be deleted
@lottasin @Krazzf true
@KrzearYT all jokes are okay or none are
@KrzearYT The commentary community is all about edgy jokes, but for some reason people view this as "too far?". This is not even near borderline.

Honestly, this sort of thing is immature and naive. Dropouts are very likely to do much worse than non-dropouts and even if you become successful on youtube (which is not guaranteed), youtube is usually not a stable income until you have millions of subs or have successful merch.

@quetzalcoatI_ @zoggyt 
@zoggyt It's the stupidest thing honestly, arguing about a hypothetical election between youtubers lol
@zoggyt I agree, I calculated that in, especially for the southern states. However white women suburbanites ("karens") aren't as much of a voter base in the Midwest, where Keemstar has a lot of support in working class men.
@zoggyt Perhaps, that's why I had Georgia being really close and NC flipping, I envision the black vote being something crazy like 92% Ethan, 4% Keem.
@zoggyt As I said in the video suburbanites would be 100% against Keem, but both candidates would be terrible enough that turnout is really low among them, weakening their influence.
@zoggyt I feel h3 would do better in New Hampshire, it's a progressive bastion and favours candidates like him who would more appeal to the upper-middle class.
@zoggyt Either way, it would be a close election, this map is plausible.
@zoggyt I agree with you there, but with two hated candidates the election is decided by the turnout and I think more people would be enthusiastic for Keem than Ethan.
@ilymais @Neoncaffeine @BrodyFoxx
@Sub2Michae1 You from Ohio?
@zoggyt I don't think much will necessarily harm Keem more than Ethan. They've both said the n word and they've both made some oopsies. Like I said this would probably be a very low turnout election with both candidates in the negative approval ratings and it would be decided on turnout.
final map  
@zoggyt Advocating for left-wing populists doesn't necessarily mean you are one. I'm more talking about populist energy and style rather than populist policies.
@zoggyt Progressives are only electable if they are populist, this is why I heavily doubted Warren's electability, the polls clearly show this. H3H3 is progressive but not populist as I said, which would hurt him in these states.
@zoggyt I think Keem's populism would help him, similar to Trump 2016. Covid and the economy are turning WWC against Trump for this election but someone without the baggage of an incumbent would win.
@zoggyt @MeMelonYT @TheTurnz_ I unironically want to debate you, or anyone for that matter.

@JohnSwanYT @RealBWC @nicholasdeorio BOIS WE HAVE A RELEASE DATE
"@thezawesome27 DM
I have an idea I think you may like..."
Having his self-harm shown to hundreds of people is not good for him. We don't have his dox or anything to call the cops so all we can do is deny him the attention.
"All members of the commentary community:
@_ThePieman__/@Tipsar5 has been threatening self-harm and suicide recently and has gained some attention. The best thing we can all do is block him and ban him from our discord servers."
If I ever get accused of sexual harassment/assault (i won't), quote retweet this post with some meme or something
@inversedaniel How would someone prove the DMs are true? Honest question.
@_ThePieman__ So if you kill yourself you will make the world a worse place.
@_ThePieman__ The world would not be better with you dead. You would make your family and friends upset for life if you killed themselves, perhaps launching them into depression too. You may not have that much of a positive effect on the world but you don't have a negative one.
@_ThePieman__ You do.
You have problems. Get help and don't make rash decisions 
He is in serious trouble

@stories_nice well even if that is him it doesn't mean he groomed anyone
I doubt public opinion will be on the accusers side this time. Pyrocynical is one of the most beloved youtubers and there have already been pedo allegations against him that were proven false. 
Never jump to conclusions before a response from Pyro. 
@LtCythix show your girlfriend
@LmmSkits He apologised countless times, what else do you expect him to do?
@LtCythix No. Honestly most people don't care. Do a poll asking your followers if they care about roblox drama, most will say no.
@LtCythix You have FANTASTIC talent. Your editing and writing skills are top-notch. If you make videos on more relevant topics (like the h3h3 one for instance) you will grow very fast, trust me.
@LtCythix wasting great talent on roblox drama

@Milkman32620254 @whaledex ok i guess?
@whaledex @Milkman32620254 ?
@Milkman32620254 @whaledex Why lol? What's wrong with my bio?
@Sub2Michae1 Your fans and friends want to see your uprise and that's what matters.
@Sub2Michae1 People get bashed for anything, especially nowadays. The best thing to do is not care about what they say. YOU know you are a good person doing good things and that is what matters, not the opinion of some whiny loser on Twitter.
@Sub2Michae1 People sadly pay more attention to negativity.
@MeMelonYT @TheTurnz_ @2_romann We probably won't talk politics that much, though we may mention stuff about it every one in a while obviously as it is election night

@Vampuffin i unironically would change my real life name to 'Pieman'. It's cringe when articles refer to youtubers by their real names so I think everyone should just call me Pieman

@SpookyNazi at least your PM's a hottie
my real name's Nat but no one call me that, it's kinda weird

@cringe_panda I apologized for then. I was completely in the wrong, but this time I wasn't doing that.

Horrible. Harassing her father on his deathbed about politics. What a way to end his life, by arguing with his daughter. 
@ilymais If you get cancelled over that, that's a different story lol. But I more mean deleting videos made a long time ago that you view as "cringy"
@RikkaIsMyGF They are a record of how your content has progressed and even though you may cringe at them now, you will regret the decision later. If you have 10 million subs one day, wouldn't you want to be able to see the first videos you ever made, how far you've come?

@RealBWC Yeah, he never asked follow questions to Alissa Violet accusing Jake of having a casting couch because he wanted Jake to look good and that went against his motive.

@LtCythix @MyUserLogic @h3h3productions @OhMarDayz @Leafy Are you not American?
@AckJigglen Disgusting. Salt and butter are the only things that can be put on popcorn.
I disagree. Republicans in NY/Cali and Democrats in red states have no power in elections because their state will always vote for one party. All votes should matter equally and right now people living in swing states are the only people whose votes count 
@zoggyt Pointing out any difference between races is racist and ignoring race is also racist
@lottasin would you consider yourself an e-girl?
well then... 
@Vampuffin True, although I would unironically support him if he does run
I am once again asking for life support 
@lottasin @_Davidplex idk about that. A 14 year old with a 17 year old or even a 15 year old with a 18 year old is kinda sus
@lottasin @_Davidplex I'd say 2 years age gap is max if they're under 18

@HighlandRocket Very hard to say. 10 years ago was 2010, which is nothing like today. There could be a Youtube competitor, there could be no Youtube, anything could happen in 10 years it is too far in the future to predict.
@Zero112788561 @HighlandRocket Probably an accident that will get fixed. Pewdiepie has fallen back into Youtube's favor since mid-2019.

@AllucidLol @WillyMacShow @TUMYBOI_M8 Being a youtuber should be entertaining people/fun first, money/popularity after.
@AllucidLol @WillyMacShow @TUMYBOI_M8 That's why I don't respect him.
@AllucidLol @WillyMacShow @TUMYBOI_M8 I'm saying you shouldn't 'do anything' to get popular.
@CommPredictions Predict something we don't know
@AllucidLol @WillyMacShow @TUMYBOI_M8 No, I said that prioritizing the algorithm over everything else as much as Dream does is something I do not respect.
@nickodium @Theview_er That is creepy.
@nickodium @Theview_er Me and @Theview_er are literally 15, we would know about it more than you.
@nickodium @Theview_er 15 year olds aren't mentally ready to have sex.
@WillyMacShow @TUMYBOI_M8 I disagree. I don't respect him because he's too into 'the algorithm', it seems to me he cares more about success than making content people love or to have fun.
@nickodium @Theview_er 12 year olds can 'enjoy' and 'want' sex but shouldn't have it
@nickodium @Theview_er Wrong. A 5 year old should not be aloud to have sex with anyone. That is a moral almost universally agreed upon.

@commentarystats Leafy is different from most terminated channels. Youtube must have done something specifically for him.
@_ThePieman__ Its possible but unlikely. Most probable scenario of a Trump win is him winning Pennsylvania + Arizona + Florida
"Update on progress for the @h3h3productions vs @KEEMSTAR rap battle:

I doubt Trump will win in Wisconsin. The only Rust Belt state possible to go Trump is Pennsylvania.

@_Davidplex @GeneralHayley A 19 year old should not be responsible for what they did at age 12.
@_Davidplex Yes you can say it was wrong, but they should be aloud in the community still.
@_Davidplex @GeneralHayley The repercussions are them apologizing and being shit on temporarily. I think someone can completely change in 5 years, if someone made a bad mistake once, it doesn't mean they should be ridden from the community forever.
@_Davidplex I disagree. What if at 14, you helped promote a false allegation but years later, you regret it, have apologized and done everything to undo the damage that it did. I think they would be deserving of forgiveness.
deleting in 24 hours 
@_Davidplex I think most times you can tell, even then I believe in benefit of the doubt. If someone deeply regrets their past actions, even if it is bad, they should be forgiven, like Logan Paul.
@cringe_panda Doesn't look like she's going to be retiring from politics any time soon though
@_Davidplex It depends on how young. If you are 11 or even 14, you will understandably mature and view past actions in a different light.
@cringe_panda @sewernugget What after that?
This is relating to drama a certain very young person was involved in
If you make bad decisions and you are very young, you deserve another chance.
@LtCythixdad @TeamYouTube also you accidentally posted the picture twice
@LtCythixdad @TeamYouTube If it is on Shive's video, she could have a filter that removes comments with certain words in it

@nuitNo6 @Leafy A older person attracted to a person who is still developing is a pedophile, not just people attracted to people who haven't started puberty yet (which is extremely young)
@nuitNo6 Well I technically am agnostic but the chance of god existing is so small and I treat the universe like none exists so I am a practical atheist
@nuitNo6 how?
@nuitNo6 @Leafy Anyone attracted to children should feel shame
@sketchdweller @AndreiTerbea But if it happens then what?
@sketchdweller @AndreiTerbea I mean if two 11 year olds fuck
@nuitNo6 @Leafy How young do you think is the limit to adults being attracted to them?
@sketchdweller @AndreiTerbea If 11 year olds have sex what happens? That is below all European countries age of consent but they don't go to jail. Things can be illegal without them going to jail.
@nuitNo6 @Leafy Wouldn't older people be attracted to people who have completed or near-completed puberty though? 12 and 13 year olds who are menstruating but otherwise have no signs of puberty would not be attractive to almost every adult
@sketchdweller @AndreiTerbea Its a deterrent

@KEEMSTAR Gok's video should not have been taken down but neither should "content nuke". By asking questions like this one, you are inadvertently gunning for it's removal. This will only continue to fuck everyone. The question you should ask is; "Do you AGREE that this video was removed?"

RT @grandayy : The Copyright Directive including Article 13 has just been approved by EU Parliament. A vote for amending and improving it was rejected by a difference of just 5 votes too. Sad day for internet freedom in Europe.

@kritipunjabi @iNabberTV @massiveismental yes, if he wants
@iNabberTV wrong, my man ain't sleeping behind the wheel 
@CynicalComments @RealBWC that's a different argument though. And again, as an actor, you'd face the same challenges
@CynicalComments @RealBWC why not though? I don't think anyone would say the same for an actor. Most actors don't have degrees in acting
@RealBWC @CynicalComments also, pretty sure you don't need a degree to be a chimney sweeper, but that's still a job
@nopeifyaltalt @PyrocynicalTV 
@Bowblax @PyrocynicalTV @RealBWC lol
@PyrocynicalTV welcome to the club
@LeonLush deserved for using light mode
@RealYungCripp you are safe, for now
@TheRightOpinion @iNabberTV my systems of reasoning have detected you are a massive gay
@iNabberTV @TheRightOpinion both of you are under 25 and are therefore beneath me. You could have studied rocket science, but the simple fact of the matter is; your brains have not yet developed. Don't blame me, blame science for this. Message me again when you are 25 or older
@iNabberTV scientifically speaking, you are less human
"@iNabberTV your brain hasn't developed yet
- a scientific fact"
@Kwite thank you
@grandayy @DolanDark I thought you were the same person
@grandayy @DolanDark Dr Grandayy 25+ confirmed
@DolanDark @grandayy I expect nothing less from someone under the age of 25
@grandayy my brain is like a beehive in which every bee has a brain like yours
@chiliCSGO wrong
@PyrocynicalTV that's something someone under the age of 25 would say
@ianni_powerup Jake Paul is only 22 and that answers a-lot of questions
@NuzgarDdraig wrong
@NuzgarDdraig under 25 weakling 
the human brain doesn't fully develop until you hit 25 years of age. If you're under 25, I'm automatically better than you

@KEEMSTAR good interview. Hard to believe that dude is smarter than the 1.7 million people that subscribed to him, but that's really the only explanation for it
@grandayy I suck at both, that's all I know

@JustDestinyYT ah
@grandayy once saw a channel with a million subscribers and 0 uploads, I think it was Sidemen. But that was cheating anyway

@KEEMSTAR it's impressive how many times you've fallen for it at this point
@raaachellouisee @PDPIdeas then you misinterpreted. I like fat jokes, I make them all the time, I actually wasn't making one here
@raaachellouisee @PDPIdeas no, because context. The joke is "she's fake" not "she's fat"
@raaachellouisee @PDPIdeas lol I'm not implying it, it's facts
@raaachellouisee @PDPIdeas didn't call her a pig, it's just a little pot belly, who cares? It's just funny that she felt the need to try and fool her followers

@jenesin_ @ColossalIsBlazy in this example the verb has already trumped the word "on" so changes the rules

@FuckBamboni might get it for stream, is it really graphics intensive, or will it work on a gaming laptop?

@LeonLush it's the only way I've ever been able to quit smoking
@Koloco_ because he was Asian
@DolanDark it's an inspiring story
watched a 300lb asian man run 15kms on treadmill today. It was freakishly impressive. I made the mistake of congratulating him afterwards. Maybe he lost control of his body like he SAID he did, but in all my life, I have never smelt anything more horrific

@JustDestinyYT @stillgray you're weird you are
@JustDestinyYT @stillgray what
@JustDestinyYT @stillgray "cool videos about children" how is that deceptive? Are they not cool videos about children?
@stillgray it's mostly kids themselves that watch this shit, sprinkled with a few perverts
@stillgray cool videos about children
@grandayy rise and grind
@BerardLarry @JustinWhang I actually don't know
@JustinWhang FUPA was a genuinely good idea and needs to be resurrected somehow
@anything4views @KEEMSTAR same
@Mistergloworm @LeonLush @ultrajoecomic yes and that's exactly why it's funny to me. I can't believe everyone falls for this every single time. Fat debate sparked, only real winners are the company because they're just a-lot smarter than their customers. Every single time
@bluefireify @LeonLush @ultrajoecomic it's not a mistake in terms of effectiveness. Look at how many fell for it and look at everyone talking about it, including us. It's both clever and shady at the same time. Those two adjectives often go hand in hand in advertising I think
@tealcisdawsony @ultrajoecomic rings a bell, but it would have been about 8 years ago, so can't remember
@LeonLush @ultrajoecomic big facts. When you consider their motive, they've done nothing worth clapping about
@tealcisdawsony @ultrajoecomic did you ever see that anti-racist skin cream commercial? (I think it was Dove) That shit was hilarious
@ultrajoecomic the funniest thing about it has gotta be all the suckers that got manipulated into thinking Gillette are actually trying to do something other than sell razors, especially when advertisers have been pulling this same stunt for decades

@tordsland @VincentHatesGod used to, not anymore. He got given the greenlight to re-own his channel again himself in late 2016 I believe
@VincentHatesGod I doubt they've approached him directly. But perhaps Keem and De Franco etc are hesitant to cover the story after seeing the blatant blacklisting of anyone even remotely associated with you. Not even an irrational fear and that's just insane if you think about it

@Naranja_Ninja @RealBWC that's interesting, not what I was told at all and I heard it from a trustworthy source that was there at the trial. Strange
@Naranja_Ninja @RealBWC insane if true. I was told he won by someone who was at the trial. But if not true, since he's not in prison, under house arrest or anything I can't see how he lost
@NEX_to_Nothing he literally had like 50 chances already, everyone keeps falling for it
@Naranja_Ninja @RealBWC rape is a minor offence?
@FSpaceball @RealBWC nothing surprises me anymore tbh
@SpaceOink @Levi_Van_Dartel @FatCunnt the joke could not be more obvious, but I can't say I'm surprised
@RealBWC it is true, he's been back for a long time now, don't know why keem is just posting about it now. He won the court case so he can stream legally. Ethically is another question entirely

@Pinggaz @KEEMSTAR @anything4views I wouldn't but it's not the reason we haven't been making baited. I do really want to give the podcast one more real push over the next few months and pump out episodes. If we fail again, then I think I'll call it a day
@DeodorAnthony or better yet don't pander at all I reckon
@DeodorAnthony I can definitely think of examples where you're 100% right so yeah it really is a case by case basis thing I think
@DeodorAnthony idiots will watch anything though. The main thing I've noticed is; they don't really know what's good and what isn't so they use numbers to gauge everything. I reckon they'll stick around as long as the common perception is; "you're popular"
@DeodorAnthony for sure. But for example, imagine if you don't make videos for idiots, but someone who does, promotes it to idiots. You're gonna get idiots watching even if you didn't originally intend those idiots to watch. Basically, you're right but really only on a case by case basis
@DeodorAnthony a bit for sure, but so many mitigating factors beyond your control also

@PyrocynicalTV best video 
@ItsLucasReturns @PerkaholicTV word of caution though. The interview I did was GENUINELY the hardest thing I've ever done. I've got a ton of life experience and I was still out of my depth. If he gets one over on you in the interview and benefits, that's something you gotta live with for the rest of you life
@ItsLucasReturns @PerkaholicTV I mean I can't really see what's wrong with that. My interview was used in the court case against him and was nothing but a good thing, he benefited in no way from it
@ItsLucasReturns @PerkaholicTV situation over my arse, he was in court 6 months later. Separate from that, I don't think anyone should care if you interview a pedo peter, unless your interview supports them

@KingUnoriginal @StargateLord @FatCunnt @KEEMSTAR yes, you're concerned about a (tame) joke made about a wifebeater. But because you don't even understand what to be outraged over anymore, your broken brain is telling you it's wrong. In reality... you've just concerned yourself for a psychpath's feelings. Well done
@KingUnoriginal @FatCunnt @KEEMSTAR fuck off
@KingUnoriginal @FatCunnt @KEEMSTAR barely a joke, since it's literally what he does. Also I'm supposed to feel bad for making a joke about a wifebeater now? You guys are pathetic

@FatCunnt @KEEMSTAR how the fuck am I being a cunt

@TheLordVega doubt it, all they have to do is just not respond. It's such a grey area that even if it did go to court, they'd probably win anyway
@TheLordVega they're too big to fight, nothing anyone can do. I wrote multiple emails, ZERO response. I even spoke to the creators of cuphead, the song the game is used in, they didn't care that I was using it but even THEY couldn't do anything about it
@TheLordVega there's another one called CMG "Create Music Group" pretty much the exact same thing, they're the ones behind my last video getting claimed
@grandayy @KEEMSTAR @pewdiepie the article is straight-up bait. Purposefully shit for attention
"@grandayy @KEEMSTAR @pewdiepie ""literally be literally""

leafy?"
@Paradomix64 fake outrage breeds fake apology. They know they've done nothing, it's just convenient for them to apologize to save their own skin
@itsniallryan and money. The big ones all have a paypal link in their bio
stop apologizing for every minor slip-up and cowering before people pretending to be outraged. This is why they're winning
@LeonLush yeah you right. When comedians/youtubers/whoever cave to this shit, these fake outrage fuckers win and it just makes it that much easier for them to get away with it in the future
@LeonLush I don't really agree with that. Ricky said it best 
@Mrirish_ @LeonLush he didn't have to, he chose to
@LeonLush it's completely pathetic and I'm not even SYMpathetic since he backed down like a coward
@iNabberTV yup, because kevin hart is more popular than some random internet pedo. Therefore more money, therefore more "criers", therefore more idiots riled up, therefore more of an impact. Same thing every-time lol
@iNabberTV fake outrage has always been a thing, it's just a-lot more popular now because there's more money in it. Crying for a living is an actual job title now. These people are also big on censorship so they always call for "cancellation" &amp; that riles up all the impressionable teenagers

@LeonLush @MrBeastYT champ
"@KEEMSTAR @LeonLush @MrBeastYT yeah you owe me baited money since December 2017

@DolanDark @PyrocynicalTV subscribe to colossal is crazy for daily content
@rosechickn @PyrocynicalTV smart
@LeonLush @MrBeastYT you better win and when you do I think you should give me 10K
@PyrocynicalTV i don't think so
@nopeifyaltalt @grandayy @KEEMSTAR was looking for a robin on red dead
@bigmates they're epic
@ColossalIsBlazy same
@BamboniReturns @JustinWhang buggy as fuck &amp; like I said before, Rockstar just don't know how to balance things AT ALL. They hired some genuine creative geniuses and sat them at the same desk as a baboon. All that said, I still love the multiplayer, but you really gotta play it with friends. It'll get better
@KSIOlajidebt you're a true fan 
@Nehmer4Life @KEEMSTAR @anything4views @DeMar_DeRozan @kevinlove I like how even when I capitalize the word "most" people still can't read
@Lyricoldrap @KEEMSTAR @NetNobody ye "colossaliscrazy" is my PSN
@AhMADNE55 @KEEMSTAR @NetNobody add me "colossaliscrazy" on PSN
@KEEMSTAR @NetNobody keem let's play red dead
@nopeifyaltalt no
i made this 
RT @LittleWitchDays : Little rat friends @ColossalisCrazy 
@BackwardsHatTV don't agree
@BamboniReturns I made mads mikkelson with down-syndrome somehow
@ColossalIsBlazy in like 30 minutes
@Pinelyy @LeonLush @ElvisTheAlienTV John Carter
@Pinelyy @LeonLush @ElvisTheAlienTV maybe, though I don't think how well a movie does at the box office necessarily equates to how "good" a movie is
@JoeGaudi @LeonLush @ElvisTheAlienTV yeah I also read the books long before the show. Still enjoyed the show. It's erratic, case by case basis
@LeonLush @ElvisTheAlienTV we're old as fuck, we're probably an exception to the rule
@BatteriaYT @LeonLush @ElvisTheAlienTV didn't see that one tbh
@LilPakiVert @LeonLush @ElvisTheAlienTV yeah I really enjoyed that also
@Jacy2244 yes
@LeonLush @ElvisTheAlienTV doesn't work every-time, for example I despised the charlie and the chocolate factory one. Probably different because it was a direct remake as opposed to animation ---&gt; live action stuff
@ultrajoecomic @LeonLush @ElvisTheAlienTV hahaha
@LeonLush @ElvisTheAlienTV I genuinely enjoyed the movie and I'll probably enjoy the lion king remake also, probably even more so. I went into it for nostalgia reasons and was genuinely interested to see how they'd adapt it to live action. I think it depends on what you expect going in really
@joeylockwood @anything4views I can have an opinion though, I didn't say anybody needed to take it, did I?
@daytimefilms @anything4views said "most"
@joeylockwood @anything4views I feel like you probably just need to be chased by a wild animal in the Savannah. You won't be depressed then
@Ramskerr @anything4views understandable if your life revolves around YouTube. The trick is to not let that happen and have other hobbies
@khal_aros @anything4views need to get your facts right I think
@khal_aros @anything4views even as a youtuber I can confirm it's not inescapable. I can go without using the internet for months at a time and I've done just that in the past
@qkakakakakakak @anything4views that's the answer I think. Try not using internet for a week, you'll probably feel much better
@khal_aros @anything4views did you try leaving the internet for a bit?
@qkakakakakakak @anything4views if you've got other things like anxiety for instance, it's obviously that much harder and that's why I said this is only for "most". That said, you're on the internet typing this so perhaps you haven't tried everything I suggested
@khal_aros @anything4views yes, I truly believe it works in most cases. Exercise is underrated
@RealYungCripp @khal_aros @anything4views for you it's impossible, so I get it
@khal_aros @anything4views for some people it's hard, for others it's impossible. For most, it shouldn't be that difficult to turn off the internet and go for a walk
@anything4views I feel like depression can be cured for MOST people just by staying active, eating right and having something to focus on/strive for. Shut up at home, alone, glued to the internet all day every day is definitely going to poison your mind over time
@KEEMSTAR fake as fuck boyyyy
@sid_sriraman @grandayy @massiveismental yeah, been that way ever since I got account back i think
@grandayy nobody really knows because twitter has zero documentation on it. Probably closes certain doors for you. You won't appear in the "who to follow" tab for example. It's why my @massiveismental account gets more followers than this one even when I haven't tweeted there in months
@jak_mockery @dulhunty @KEEMSTAR @Twitch twitch staff just really like garfield I think
@dulhunty @KEEMSTAR @Twitch wasn't even anything visual, I just mentioned Garfield's asshole
@Lead3r_ @KEEMSTAR @Twitch not joking
@KEEMSTAR @Twitch a twitch staff member suspended me because I mentioned Garfield's asshole
"@Sunnyracc @ViddeBoy520 @KEEMSTAR 

I actually did though"
@JHebertSide95 @tommycsftp @massiveismental I hit up @netnobody he's the dude that got my account back to begin with and the only person I know that can do anything at all
@tommycsftp @JHebertSide95 @massiveismental haha yeah of course, but twitter never respond
@tommycsftp @JHebertSide95 @massiveismental when I got my account back i think they put a proverbial black mark against it which restricts me from search options and shit
@tommycsftp @JHebertSide95 it's restricted for some people and has been for months I think. If you go to socialblade @massiveismental an account which hasn't tweeted in months gets more followers than @ColossalisCrazy it makes zero sense

@SithSalty @iNabberTV just big facts
@TheLordVega @iNabberTV you know I'm right, you know I'm right
@iNabberTV I don't need ten million subs to know I'm the best youtuber on the platform, gaming genius next level epic mastermind and very good-looking with no discernible flaw to speak of at all :))
@iNabberTV I have this slick theory... feel free to steal this. For your next youtube thumbnail just put a close-up on the eyes of the person you're talking about. When the idiots are scrolling through youtube they're gonna focus on those eyes, like they're being stared at. Animal instinct
@PaynosTV @iNabberTV no shit... because everyone does it. Luck at the end of the day, this is the deciding factor in the clickbait game. But you gotta be in it to win it at-least
@TheNarratorHere @iNabberTV ok yeah I've seen SOME smart clickbait and I'm like "damn that's clever" but cmon' like 99% of the rest of it is a copy/paste job
@iNabberTV I mean... we are and we aren't brother. You really don't need to do much research to get your title right, it's literally... "look at some of the more popular videos, copy/paste the approach, little trial and error" and bingo. Most know how to clickbait man, some choose not to
@ImAllexx @iNabberTV 
@ImAllexx @iNabberTV yeah you dumb you dumb
@ImAllexx @iNabberTV test for yourself. No tags and 20 tags. If you increase your views by a quantifiable amount, I'll delete my channel. This is how sure I am. I've tested with tags and without, have you?
"@ImAllexx @iNabberTV don't even know what you're on now you weird muppet. Clickbait doesn't always equate to a lie, like at all, where was that even mentioned? 

Title and thumbnail TRUMP any other thing you can do by a ludicrous amount. Everything pales by comparison"
@iNabberTV they're redundant. I use one single word for my tags... "no". Title and thumbnail trump literally every other thing by a ridiculous amount
@ImAllexx @iNabberTV "release time, title, descriptions, tags" is the quoted tweet, only one of em' actually makes a genuine difference and that's the title,so at the end of the day you may as well clickbait. Best advice really. As for release time, erratic at best
@iNabberTV Tags are redundant. Timed release is erratic and often a gamble. You're right that titles can be shitter than others and that will 100% make a difference, but ultimately clickbait titles = best option anyway, so may as well do that. All in all, it's not particularly good advice
"@iNabberTV in other words... clickbait like a bitch

you really don't have to be too smart to clickbait, it's not some kind of skill. I don't give a wet one if someone clickbaits or not, but to say it's lazy to choose not to, is bollocks"

@iNabberTV @LeonLush 
VERY high chance of Article 13 getting through. It's got mainstream support. If it does, my channel will end up getting blocked/removed. What I'll do is make a new channel and have an American friend run it on my behalf. It'll be really annoying to do, but I WOULD start again

@LeonLush RIP I think it'll probably go through as well, it's getting celebrity support

@DOOM_BFG @cock_facee literally contacted me first and have tagged me in shit over 50 times at this point, because mad. But yes... you should have ignored ME

@VinalG4ce I've never really cared for Bethesda games in general. An abundant lack of main missions and far too many pointless side ones
@BamboniReturns I only watched a few videos, I like what they did with VATS. The most positive thing people were saying all revolved around the looting, which I've never cared for anyway. Is it me or did the graphics look abysmal?

@ThePipLad @TitanTaff @Venmona2 all I know is, it ain't a straight
@BamboniReturns I think with a game this size it's allowed maybe 3 of those. When Skyrim first came out, no joke, this must have happened to me over 100 times
@BamboniReturns damn, that's odd, haven't encountered a single major bug yet
@ThePipLad @TitanTaff @Venmona2 the plot thickens, were you lying about being a sexless loser too?
@ThePipLad @TitanTaff @Venmona2 so they finally allowed you to use the stapler?

@LordOdinO_colon &gt; witcher 3
@kevinoriordan20 I think so, I doubt we'll see a game like this again for a very long time
@EdwardTemple11 *2
pending the muliplayer living up to expectations, I may actually make a video for main channel on Red Dead.I think the game is genius and I'd even argue that it's the best game ever made despite the weird balancing stuff. The video would try and prove that I guess
@AidanKind i don't think so i don't think so
@nopeifyaltalt @DolanDark @rooting_around ^
@DolanDark @rooting_around facts here
@DolanDark damn, you the type of dude that has to use deadeye to find his own dick :pp
@PetriDishBoy @KEEMSTAR it actually fucked with his ego to see a balance of 5 dollars
@KEEMSTAR yes because you used a cheat glitch within first hour of playing, because you couldn't fucking STAND to be poor for a second, even in a virtual game. We've already had this conversation mungo
@MajorLeagueWobs not even that exaggerated from reality
@MentooTimesup @haydenwaltis it does, just not a lot of it. I've played 48 hours so far (approx) didn't use fast travel once
@thewavywebsurf I love the poker, though I wish they'd added more than ONE animation for when you win a hand. Like they got animations for the most minor things, but then something you are going to see A LOT of only one? That didn't make sense to me
@bunsenguy I think you're just rushing it and this game punishes you for rushing, which is a good thing imo
@bunsenguy I actually love that shit because it's hilarious
@haydenwaltis I absolutely hate fast travel in video-games so this was a breath of fresh air. As for the animation speeds, for single-player it's absolutely fine, but I DO hope they increase it for multiplayer otherwise it just won't be as fun
@BamboniReturns it's the best game I've played in forever. Rockstar suck at balancing though, I'm really really hopeful they get it right with the multiplayer
@papurrs GOTY for me, though God of War came close
@RealYungCripp haha yeah i saw that one going around a lot. It obviously makes the game the slice of genius it is, but in many areas take something away from the gameplay in a really significant way
@haydenwaltis work of art I reckon
@ErnestArts_ when multiplayer comes out
@DonkeviusMC I think it's one of the best games in the last 5 years so I would say now
Red Dead is a straight-up masterpiece. Some weird balancing though. For example, you've got 5 different types of bullets to 1 gun (overkill) &amp; you can only craft 1 bullet at a time. No downside over regular bullets, so you just sit there for 30 minutes holding down the X button
@Chill_Cams you are right, but I was also locked out of twitter till a few days ago
@ColossalIsBlazy @feelinyawave need to announce it again, because I think there were only 5 submissions last I checked
@UpToHerCicatrix still got lag so afraid not, my speedtest says my internet connection is solid, so not sure what it is. I'm moving airbnb so hopefully that'll fix it
@feelinyawave when I figure out how to fix the lag, may need a different internet connection
@KEEMSTAR 3. abducted by aliens
@KEEMSTAR yeah we're doing a baited on this I think
@FelixMcgreg I do yeah. I recommend Adobe Premiere Elements. It's very easy to learn and quick to use and only costs about 40 bucks for the full program. I use it for 95% of any video. I use AE for the more complex shit that elements can't do but NOT cheap and NOT easy. Start with Elements

@nopeifyaltalt @KEEMSTAR where is the leafy interview
@UpToHerCicatrix @KEEMSTAR I tried starting a stream yesterday but the upload speed was too low, need to move to a different airbnb
@UpToHerCicatrix @KEEMSTAR damn
@KEEMSTAR yes karma is a bitch. Replace this with;"where's the video clown?" every-day for 2 years
@stillgray @elonmusk half the cryptocurrency community ARE just straight up scammers, even some of the most popular accounts
@LeonLush 
@grandayy this is the VR segment, you need to jump off a ledge in real life to get past this bit
@Signal600YT @LeonLush @YouTube yeah I don't like that guy
@charmedskull @LeonLush @YouTube it's just more youtube censorship at the end of the day, it's been snowballing for some time now and it's only gonna get worse i reckon
@Signal600YT @LeonLush @YouTube charity is a good thing, I'm a big believer in it. But I also believe it should always be a voluntary thing and not compulsory
@charmedskull @LeonLush @YouTube I wonder if they'll try and somehow disable streamlabs when streaming on youtube now. Wouldn't surprise me honestly
@Signal600YT @LeonLush @YouTube I think it's probably less selfless than all that, several people pointed out it might be tax deductible for youtube and some other stuff. In any case... it's a pretty dumb idea flying under something more positive that YouTube takes all the credit for. That's how I interpret it
@Signal600YT @LeonLush @YouTube it will, it 100% will
"@LeonLush @YouTube 5 dollar superchat: ""youre moms dick""

@kritipunjabi @HappyHotMess_ oh yeah forgot about this piece of genius
@nopeifyaltalt pyrocynical
@KEEMSTAR @pewdiepie @shanedawson oh... I thought he already did 
@pewdiepie one for the record books
@HappyHotMess_ a bit, but not really. I've never really talked too much about Jake Paul. Probably because everyone else had it covered. I think there was that one episode of Baited and then tweets with the boxing match, I can't think of another point in time I discussed him and his antics
@DogByf time to do it with the new video
@pewdiepie *quadruple
@Yoo_Tooba every time Jake Paul says like put a pig noise
like inside like the mind of like jake paul 
@olaxpw see above

@BrockBaker no competition 
@rooting_around @pewdiepie my question also
@beastmaster1964 @KEEMSTAR 
@KEEMSTAR I disagree with this
@nopeifyaltalt 
@nopeifyaltalt shut up today
@captnkyrsh ye, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the series. It doesn't have to have a big conclusion to be good. If it's entertaining, that's all that matters really. It was a bit drawn out, he should have slimmed it down, but a blowjob is still a blowjob at the end of the day
@LeonLush "a cool blowjob"
@captnkyrsh entertainment I'd say, it's the most important thing
@Paradomix64 nah I don't mean like there has to be a big conclusion or something, I don't know, maybe my metaphor is shit
@EKR74 now that's big facts

"@k_e_n_o__ @KEEMSTAR @anything4views @watsky his brain is even slower than yours I'm afraid

@k_e_n_o__ @KEEMSTAR @anything4views @watsky I don't talk fast your brain is just slow
@triangleDAYS I don't speak fast, your brain works slow :))
@peachymiin_ it was certainly a lot less stressful
@UGotThtOneThing yeah gonna get Chad to do it for next episode, he knows more than I do
"@SuckMuhBeef did I speak too fast or is your brain too slow?

Nah I get it, but you can also change the speed of the video if you need to slow it down a bit. Also I just watched with subtitles on and it's almost a perfect translation"
bonus episode of Baited 
@hoysity my tonight
@trinKaus__ @MrBeastYT @Aaron_Doh @owenvideo @robertoblake yes tonight
@MrBeastYT @Aaron_Doh @owenvideo @robertoblake I'd put money on it factoring in, but there'll also be other variables... I doubt it's based on ONE thing alone, so you're probably both right
RT @nerdcity : @ColossalisCrazy @DolanDark @nopeifyaltalt 
@JoeySalads he doesn't, he exaggerated everything. Certainly for BH he would have had little to no overheads, I can't imagine it cost him a cent.
@DolanDark @nopeifyaltalt 
@psychobartus MY tonight, it's still the morning for me
@nopeifyaltalt mission accomplished
@anything4views I'll link your pig livestream in the description where you reacted to his response, the one where you straight-up STOLE one of my points. Yeah I saw it, I saw it
due to Keem's twitter ban and a few timezone complications... tonight I'm gonna release a special bonus episode of the Baited podcast on the channel. No Keem &amp; Chad, just the best member of the podcast breaking down Philip's response so you guys get some context for next episode
@ElvisTheAlienTV what's funny is; he didn't even need to use his third party ad agency to deal with Betterhelp, he's got no overheads there. Dude is not doing much more beyond sending and responding to emails
@Zester you're an odd one
@Zester pretty standard isn't it
@nopeifyaltalt I don't think so
@nopeifyaltalt yeah you stole it from me
"RT @ultrajoecomic : drawing for the video ""FouseyTube: An Alternate Reality [2]""
 #fousey  #fouseytube  #Rose &gt;  "
@nopeifyaltalt it's not
and now they've removed ALL their video testimonials... I mean cmon'
@DCsir92 @pewdiepie good point
@Pinelyy @robvaran @pewdiepie yeah of course, it's highly unlikely... good to explore all possibilities though
@robvaran @pewdiepie it'd be crazy if true, maybe you get a price reduction for leaving a video testimonial... I'm wracking my brain honestly
@pewdiepie customer might've hired the actor to read it for him due to fear of being on camera. Why they felt it was THAT important to leave a testimonial that they'd pay someone to do it... I have no idea. I find it unlikely. Hopefully we'll discover more actors within the testimonials
@ColossalIsBlazy @massiveismental no
@Useless__Nobody @massiveismental smart
@carson78938959 @massiveismental tomorrow... I hope
@UpToHerCicatrix I genuinely do apologize, I honestly think I'll be able to tomorrow
@EternalVanguard the more the better
@semmler I think they'll already be involved now
@ChirsXBlade @JhbTeam yeah, it's literally just a task of going through and trying to compare the actors with the testimonials. It's a massive job, I can't think of any way it might be made easier
@dolan_dawg @Ryan_Bell2000 not sure yet
@Ryan_Bell2000 sorry mate, I will really try tomorrow, but we gotta get this Baited out
@TheOne713_ @Mikecashman82 @nicholas_deorio @Baited_Podcast @KEEMSTAR right and also, baited wasn't uploading for ages, now we're uploading frequently. It'll take some time, but we've doing well considering our hiatus
@Ben__Masta too bold a claim for me tbh, but it's certainly indicative of shady shit isn't it
that's just one but I guarantee there are other actors to be found in the testimonials, it's just a matter of finding them. Time consuming job to be sure, I spent 2 hours on it 3 days ago and found NOTHING. Fiverr isn't the only website where you can hire these actors also
@fangirlofyt still need to record it, I'm glad we waited though
@ThePatMann @stillgray @Dractonis just go to his fiverr profile
@Mikecashman82 @nicholas_deorio @Baited_Podcast @KEEMSTAR actually, not that's even important, but we are practically getting the same EXACT views we were when baited started ironically. Maybe you should check for yourself
@stillgray @Dractonis i knew it
@nicholas_deorio @Baited_Podcast @KEEMSTAR we get 100s of thouands of views per episode
@tok_toupee 
@DeadonDaveV @anything4views @JustTheTrueBob yeah no worries, I entered into the conversation to discuss whether or not this was a scam, that's all I was doing. I still do not believe the topic was set-up to exclusively discuss legalities and even if it was, it's MORE than fair to say one could easily misunderstand that
@DeadonDaveV @JustTheTrueBob Like I said, never intended to discuss this from a legal standpoint, I know literally nothing about US law, that WOULD probably be irresponsible were I to do that. Look at all my content, when do I discuss legalities of things? Rarely ever... always been more about the shadiness
@DeadonDaveV @anything4views @JustTheTrueBob also Dave there ARE a lot of facts beyond the terms of service out there already, obviously more theories than facts for sure, but there's enough for you guys to touch on more, just as we've been doing. Tommy and yourself have only really touched on ONE thing thus far
@patrickhobley @anything4views ok I will make sure we add in "gamble at your own risk" next time we are sponsored by them, that's probably fair
@DeadonDaveV @anything4views @JustTheTrueBob I think you were both idiots with this one for sure, but yes... time will tell :)
@DeadonDaveV @JustTheTrueBob I think my point from the beginning was ;that it's not in every case and there are plenty of "scams" that are not criminal. Therefore I have every right to call it a "scam" and it is not irresponsible in any way for me to do so, since it's fair to say it is
@anything4views @DeadonDaveV @JustTheTrueBob they are
@fruitbizzle that will of course be a point that's made
@DeadonDaveV @JustTheTrueBob I think you did with the whole "you know as well as I do" thing... in context to the conversation that made me out to be dishonest, which wasn't the case. If we go back to the conversation; the "scam always means illegal" part was never disputed or clarified by you in fairness
@DeadonDaveV @JustTheTrueBob mostly just a difference of opinion for sure, a disagreement. You both did put words in my mouth, I should probably be annoyed at that, but I'm actually not since it's twitter and things are too easily misinterpreted when presented in text format with character limits
@patrickhobley @anything4views I mean, it's a gambling site at the end of the day, not Coca Cola. As a youtuber you can't be too picky. I've turned down 100s of offers for my main channel, never done one, waiting for the RIGHT one. But since it's not my channel &amp; it's not a scam I'm happy to have it for baited
@patrickhobley @anything4views one is a scam imo, one isn't. No I'm not getting these sponsorships, Chad is, but I've raised these concerns with Chad many times,because of course I have. He assures me there is ZERO scam, I've looked into it a little myself and there's no proof of anything
@patrickhobley @anything4views 
@pewdiepie know what sort of time it'll be going up?
@MrDirkMcQuickly yup agree with everything, my thoughts also
@MrDirkMcQuickly yeah... I mean "clever" in the sense it'll easily fool the idiots and obviously that's worked since I'd say like 95% of people are on his side here
@JakeClave_ I agree that a podcast is not the best format, it's probably not something I'd make a video on though
@J0J0Aljar keem is keem, I am me
@FuvkTwetar I'm not
in my opinion Philip's response video actually makes him look worse, clever though it is. He makes good points, that will easily convince someone who doesn't know this story that well. I'll be breaking down his response on the next baited episode
@emz_sf @tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD their argument is literally that... semantical debate... as stated from beginning
@Gobdium @tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD what the fuck are you on about?
@Erzekett @tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD to be fair, he's normally fucking good in an argument but he's off his game today
"@tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD was it made after the question? YES
did he only focus on 1 element of the ""scam""? YES
was the vid a lawyer LITERALLY giving ""legal analysis"" YES
did he say a scam wasn't always something criminal? YES
is it easy to interpret the topic as; ""is betterhelp a scam?"" 100% YES

give up"
@tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD the question was: "is better help a scam?" I was answering that. It's quite clear from everything I've said that I was answering that. The "A legal analysis" part is less relevant due to the fact that it's not made part of the question AND a lawyer is literally giving "analysis"
@tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD from my viewpoint the topic is whether or not this was a scam actually and I think 99% of everyone else thought the same. I asked you why you guys are always making this about legal shit, because you do it a lot
@tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD that does not mean I have to automatically respond to it from a legal standpoint at all. And for the record I wasn't. I think even this point is weak
"@youtuberlaw @tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @PhillyD ok as a lawyer perhaps you might end this little spat for us...

Is a ""scam"" ALWAYS illegal?"
@tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD no it isn't. Why else would I say "why do you guys have to always turn this into a legal thing?" if I entered into a legal debate?
@tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD 
@aseellop @tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD I did look into it idiot, why would I be commenting on something I didn't
@tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD you're grasping at straws. Just because I replied to a thread where you linked a video from a YT lawyer doesn't mean anything. I choose my words carefully. If I wanted to come at this from a more legal standpoint, I would have said "this is criminal" in place of "this is a scam"
@TitanTaff @tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD I love when people copy/paste google definitions and think they just solved something. Words have multiple meanings in different contexts, settings and situations
"@DeadonDaveV @tommycsftp @youtuberlaw @PhillyD you are talking out of your arse Dave. You think I used the word ""scam"" to convince people of criminal activity? Get fucking real. It's not a buzzword, I just said it was not a buzzword and your ONLY context is:
""scam"" ALWAYS EQUALS ""criminal""... when it genuinely doesn't at all"
@tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD in addition to this Tommy, stop saying I should be using my platform more responsibly, not the first time you've said this. I make funny commentary videos on the internet where I call people greasy pigs. Perspective.
@tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD I call it a semantical debate because it's literally a semantical debate over the word "scam". Even going this route there are plenty of "scams" that AREN'T criminal. For this and multiple reasons I think your defense of this company is categorically flawed
"@DeadonDaveV @tommycsftp @youtuberlaw @PhillyD don't say I know something Dave, you're just putting words in my mouth

there are plenty of scams that aren't criminal. This is not some buzzword, it doesn't automatically speak to anything. You are defending a company with a piss poor semantical debate of a single word"
@aseellop @tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD when you get this caught up on one word, that's when you know your argument is weak as shit. Why bother to defend something that's clearly shady as fuck
"@tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD yup, semantical debate on the word ""scam"", just like I said. 

If I'd said ""this is criminal"" maybe it's a different story. It's not in any way irresponsible to call it a scam, you couldn't be more wrong and I think your argument is weak"
@DeadonDaveV @tommycsftp @youtuberlaw @PhillyD see what I mean... we're straight into a semantical debate on the word "scam". Weak deviation. I don't know US law, I don't need to. If I wanna say something is a scam, I can, it doesn't need to be criminal. Besides which, I can think of plenty of "scams" that aren't
@tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD why do you guys have to always turn this into a legal thing? I don't know jack shit about US law and I'd never claim to, but I don't need to to say "I think this is a scam". The quote isn't "I think this is criminal". You made this about something else I think
@tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD why do you guys have to always turn this into a legal thing? I don't know jack shit about US law and I'd never claim to, but I don't need to say "I think this is a scam". The quote isn't "I think this is criminal". You made this about something else I think
@tommycsftp @youtuberlaw @PhillyD might be a personal opinion, but it's not exactly like it's based on nothing. I see this could devolve into a semantical debate on the word "scam". Even if it transpired that it's not LITERALLY that, and I still think it is, who cares, shady company that's not worth defending
@Salter_Sam_ @tommycsftp are you joking? So if it turns out to be true that you went into a private session with a "therapist", discussed your mental health, they've taken what you've said and sell it to third parties that's not bad, everyone does that and that's a shit point? Get outta here
"@tommycsftp @youtuberlaw @PhillyD everyone just focused on the terms of service alone, it's literally only one element of the story that might constitute a scam

- employed counselors that AREN'T counselors
- counselors not even showing up
- very likely fake testimonials
- increasing evidence of data-mining

@TomasVikingsson can't see how an office visit could "inspect their inner workings" since everything is done online and they're hiring "therapist" from anywhere and everywhere BUT the office itself
@Zacda2 might have to hold it off till tomorrow due to baited
@LittleCoolMe no video, just a baited I think
@AngryExpo I'll wait for baited to give my thoughts on it, but he didn't imo
@AngryExpo I don't think he was transparent at all
@RSInterestings @epichrist tonight
@epichrist too long a story, but it's the next topic on baited if you don't mind waiting till then
spent most of the day looking into this Betterhelp shit. Hope the website gets shut down
@TheBearHimself @iNabberTV I'm not saying it can't, I just don't think it can
@iNabberTV it's another story of greed. They prey on the weak, offer them a poor service and cruelly dismiss the most needing of it when the fire gets too hot. Most of the YouTubers that promoted it are only guilty of ignorance, but one or two fucked up big time
@iNabberTV I could never see it working. Bad idea. Course it's transpired to be so much MORE than just a "bad idea". The more I learn about it, the shadier it gets. I hope the website gets shut down

@stillgray slippery slope if youtubers could be held accountable for another's misinterpretation, no matter their age. But in any case, I think pretty much everyone's videos are mostly watched by teenagers. They're the main demographic and they've always dominated all others
"@stillgray ""most people don't know the difference between therapists and psychologists""

that's mostly on those people then I think. I didn't feel it was all too misleading. The therapist being a full-time youtuber was a big giveaway for me personally"

@adam22 I think all the exaggerations (funny gasps) are for entertainment over obtaining any kind of relatibility with the viewer. Same thing when you watch Drama Alert and keem does that incredibly fake laugh. It's overreacting, but when you look at the intent behind it; not a big deal
@KEEMSTAR I told you I didn't want to be in the video
@JustDestinyYT use creator studio to remove the song you muppet. You've gotten really lucky, it's only used in the outro and won't damage the video(s) at all. You don't need to file a lawsuit... like... in any way
@nicholas_deorio @tommycsftp in fairness didn't seem like the milking was too much of an issue for him, but maybe I missed that. Long podcast. I liked how they called Shane disingenuous when comparing Jake doc to Fousey no jumper interview. Since everything they said about fousey ended up being disingenuous
@PyrocynicalTV SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU FUCKING SOCIOPATH
@TheShinPin imagine complaining about putting sociopaths in a negative light. Fucking crazy town

No stream tonight, but tomorrow"
@tommycsftp most of it isn't really coming from youtubers but the youtube audience, I've only really seen that Geordie bloke have a little pig whine, seemed pretty biased to me. As for the viewers, they'll always be crying &amp; complaining about their free content, even when it's good, forever

@BamboniReturns @Polaradical @grandayy @KingOfKazoos see I bet I would have enjoyed witcher 3 even more if that difficulty was the only option honestly, I never felt a need to use of any of those items and I probably missed out on content. But I was too tempted to go for the normal mode
@Polaradical @grandayy @BamboniReturns @KingOfKazoos used Witcher 3 before as an example. I had little to no problem with that game at it's standard difficulty, wouldn't necessarily call it a challenge. Died a handful of times mostly for stupid reasons. I think if anyone played it on the storymode difficulty they had far less fun
@Polaradical @grandayy @BamboniReturns @KingOfKazoos yes but if you eliminated that option, my theory is the person who bought the game would actually get more for their money since they'd enjoy the game more
@AngryExpo @grandayy @BamboniReturns @KingOfKazoos yes and yes
@Polaradical @grandayy @BamboniReturns @KingOfKazoos i understand they're an option, but sometimes too many options are a bad thing. I'm completely shite at video games, you can ask pretty much anyone. But I have zero fun playing something that's piss easy. Too many tempted with the easy option and they end up having less fun
@Texassmufan @BamboniReturns @KingOfKazoos yeah, I mean that's what games used to be really, if you grew up with Nintendo or Genesis. They mostly had one difficulty setting and some were hard as fuck. Still haven't beat Contra: Hard Corps in 20 years, still trying to this day. That's real longevity
@PetriDishBoy @grandayy @BamboniReturns @KingOfKazoos yeah I mean shovel knight was great
@grandayy @BamboniReturns @KingOfKazoos yeah everyone likes different things. I'll always like the classic shit though, 2d platformers mostly that don't really worry about too much beyond the gameplay
@grandayy @BamboniReturns @KingOfKazoos maybe it's because I don't really understand games JUST in it for the story, it's not really a game at that point, may as-well watch someone play it on youtube, instead of spending 50 bucks on it at that point. Main reason I never liked Telltale
@EvilGiraffes240 @BamboniReturns @DirtyDanOnline @KingOfKazoos yeah it's dumb but they've also got it set-up so it's the complete opposite way round too. For some reason they don't think just having a constant balance between the two extremes is enough
@grandayy @BamboniReturns @KingOfKazoos take Witcher 3 for example, both combat and story is slick, normal mode was absolutely fine difficulty wise, if I had no problem with it, nobody should... they really didn't need an easy mode
@BamboniReturns @DirtyDanOnline @KingOfKazoos Bethesda games basically come with their own cheat engine
@DirtyDanOnline @BamboniReturns @KingOfKazoos Bethesda is the absolute worst for it. All those different difficulties really put me off their games
@BamboniReturns @KingOfKazoos yes, any game with multiple difficulty settings automatically made shitter imo. The only time it's good is if it's in the form of New Game+ or some kind of extreme mode AFTER beating the game at the ONE standard difficulty

@FartboxAvenger @thenerdcity entertainment should  be the primary objective. I mean if someone truly wanted to call someone out there are probably better sites than YT for it. But you can have additional objectives &amp; some of them can be more selfless. Some can be more selfish too (like money) &amp; that's ok too
@epichrist @HonorTheCall dunno anything about the clout house and half of it is ricegum... pretty sure many covered that one already. As for the boxing match, it's already been covered even more than fouseytube
@AcethorGaming @ultrajoecomic *Dalai Worm
@epichrist @HonorTheCall not what you originally said but ok, nobody gonna disagree with that. There's over a million channels dedicated to criticism and probably less than 100 "popular" ones worthy of criticism right now. Every single one of them will have been criticized already 100% Gotta be realistic
@epichrist @HonorTheCall yes, let's criticize a youtuber who hasn't really done anything that worthy of criticism simply because they're popular. Shittest mentality and you're not the only one who has it, half of the reason why everyone has a hard on for Ethan Klein right now
@HonorTheCall they will get attention, subs, views and $$$s with or without the videos, may as-well make the videos if they're gonna be entertaining. I think it's technically possible they can be brought down with a video, but yeah... very very very unlikely and will probably never happen ever

@guy_the_grape what are you on about, I started working on it less than a week ago
@MrGoose0 @KavosYT @PantslessGamers @RandomStuff_YTC @YouTube if both videos are about fousey then there's guaranteed to be at-least one egg in them anyway
@svartlnaggaroth philanthropy is a great thing. There are several youtubers that do it right, he's not one of them
@DavidBr21367780 how can I expand on that? Certainly not over twitter if at all. I mentally weigh up everything, using my own personal moral compass in order to reach an opinion on whether he's fair game or not. "Mental illness" is not a shield to avoid criticism in every case. Not in his case
@DavidBr21367780 criticizing anyone in the way I criticize them is immoral by definition honestly. The question is... how immoral is it? Calling him "a sick person" in this case is overreacting. Perspective is pretty important and when you have it, you feel he's fair game. I think he's fair game
@PantslessGamers @RandomStuff_YTC @YouTube he's not a kid though. The "mental illness" label has been laid on thick. You gotta put it in perspective, his "mental illness" isn't so extreme that he's dribbling in some asylum. In that case, yes, ok. But that's not the case. Not even close.
@PantslessGamers @RandomStuff_YTC @YouTube with this logic you can't ethically criticize someone who ate their family between two slices of bread. I get this is an extreme example but I'm just making a little comedy video on the internet about some dude off his nut. It's just criticism, I'm not telling him to die
@DavidBr21367780 he's always been pretty mental yeah. He's always lived in his own reality and manipulated others for his own benefit. Criticism warranted, was then, should be now too
@MassReflux original thoughts unchanged
@uncle_zed nice  idea but September 22nd is the date of the first one, too long a wait. Looking at early August before topic is dead
@DavidBr21367780 not going to convince you over twitter that this isn't just one episode of insanity. Wait for the video. Till then, remember I made the first one nearly 2 years ago and it's title still perfectly encapsulates everything that's happened recently. Proof enough right there I think 
@MsPerfParadox if you still believe this is a one-off with fousey and is just a result of him off meds... just remember the title of this video is nearly two years old and still encapsulates what's happened recently perfectly 
@khal_aros part 2
@TheBearHimself @chipmonkz he knows it, that's why he uses it constantly
@TheBearHimself @chipmonkz part 2 will be more humorous anyway, as the 1st was too serious. Even so, I don't plan on tiptoeing around anything
@EdwardTemple11 he uses his "mental illness(es)" in order to garner sympathy. It's very effective for obvious reasons. In reality, he's a worm that will use any tool at his disposal to manipulate others to his side &amp; reduce criticism. Whether it's mental illness or even religion. He's a phony
@YoungLion1997 I genuinely might if he goes anymore insane
@L0ST5ILVER it'll pick up from where part 1 left off
@YoungLion1997 no
@TheBearHimself I agree that fousey is a mental patient, but it's not a recent thing. He's as fake now as he's ever been
@saadpersonal gotta work, but any free-time I get basically
I liked Keem's doc, despite what some are saying. My main criticism is that he's far too sympathetic &amp; goes way too easy on him. Actually most videos I've seen thus far are a little too cautious in their approach. Don't feel sorry for him, so mine won't reflect that. 25% finished
RT @ultrajoecomic : wip 
@TrueSerpentCult it's not a mental episode at all, more like a mental "series". He's said shit like this many times in the past. Maybe he's not like it 24/7 but it's got little to do with one manic episode
@DetDeckard @Yoo_Tooba keem wasn't in on anything. All the false shit is from fousey and his team. Lies and deception, then convenient cover-up basically
@CommentCopped I will I will
@Yoo_Tooba he managed to fool idiots and children but that's not really saying all that much
@Yoo_Tooba sounds both
@manuel_leg I will cover them also yeah
I have to laugh at people saying "fousey was off his meds and that's why he broke down... leave him be". He's got you all fooled. Same person he's always been, on or off this... "medication". Here's a clip from when he was apparently still ON it, should all sound eerily familiar 
@MultiFamousDude yeah gotta be this month before people lose all interest in the topic
@Diggorymorrell so about 12-13 hours from now
@CornTheMighty all will be concluded
@grande1899 look at this positive outlook, are you fouseytube?
@r4bb17 dropped for now for this
@TacoZombie64 had to wait for the right time
@jdm_godzilla not that interested in it
I AM working on fouseypube part 2, dropped everything else for now. Hopefully I can finish it before the topic completely dies. Not too worried about repeating what others are saying, since there's a lot more to add outside of his failed event. Streaming tonight on Twitch also
@jdm_godzilla I am making part 2 of fouseytube hopefully I can finish it before the topic is completely dead

@Babichenko_YT I guess keep it the way you do shading now with solid colors, but just slightly more detailed in where you put  the shadows 
@Babichenko_YT Personally I think it looks slightly weird, but I'm still okay with it. it's like a 2D drawing trying to look 3D with shading, but the style of the drawing doesn't allow it to look 3D, so it looks a little weird.

@BasedSerbian @Dr_Neo_ long story short: he got banned once and Liz was basically being played into unbanning and banning him over and over. people were fighting over if it was justified or not, which i think it was. it was just a mess man
Wait Twitter supports pedophilia because the @ symbol, which is essential to Twitter, is just like this pedophile symbol. 
@mann_hydra BlazedSMP 2
@ChefGustavo1882 I like the sound of that, so I'll probably steal it later
"My brain really said, ""it's horni time""

Also idk why I had the idea to put hex maniac in lady dimitrescu's outfit "
@nicholasdeorio Nick do you identify as one of these "birthing people"
Oh yeah I forgot to tell y'all that I showed my friend the degen drawings I've been doing for the past few months 
@KrishnanandKJ08 Yeah, why use code KEEM when you can use Code DeOrio
Just finished my final History Test, I  feel like shit, I think I did bad, the usual feelings after taking a test

Did Luke slander and try to manipulate Harley? probably. Did Luke silence Harley? No."
i just saw Harley's new video and I think it's really bad. it adds nothing that we didn't already know about Luke, it just adds upon what we knew. the title is also really bad because this was mostly about how luke can't take criticism, Not about how luke silenced harley.
@em_dee_ess so what if im a John Swan stan? we're all just having fun, we're not hurting anyone and we're just stan accounts like everyone else. what's important is to have fun. who cares if i enjoy being a John Swan stan? why do i have to be private quote retweeted for being who i wanna be?

Let's say that skipper did steal his idea. Okay then, who cares? A commentary iceberg doesn't add anything to the conversation, and nobody owns an idea, so yeah. I think this whole thing is cringe
Wait I just looked at pieman's tweets, and he thinks he was right about the thing with skipper? He uploaded the iceberg publicly, so now anyone could use it. I don't get what fucking argument could you make that skipper stole your video idea after knowing that.

@MrBadOptics @vichoparrapavez Alright but the idea that someone made an entire sexuality just to exclude trans people sounds transphobic, no? There's definitely is some people who just prefer cis people, but the core idea behind it sounds transphobic.

@VerumZero Competitive simping
@vichoparrapavez @MrBadOptics I know it wasn't made for transphobes, but let's be honest, it's the transphobes sexuality

@MrBadOptics i would kick your ass
@Amberoseone look, if it doesn't make you happy or you don't like it, is it even what's right for you? "what's right for me" always felt like a vauge term, but it should probably mean a pursue of happiness, instead of trying to be successful, or "what i must do".

I'm pissed that George floyd gaming got put into cringe, he was a great commentary channel, maybe even the best
@LuffyzMonkey @BanishedJourno Yeah :)

@BanishedJourno Ricegum is best YouTuber for that one 
@LuffyzMonkey This one? 
@AugieRFC Lol I had the same experience when I went to Mexico after 2 years of not going, I only had 5gb of data and I wasted that shit quickly.

Dawg John Cena almost lived up to his song because I didn't even notice this was him 
Yeah, that was a lot of shit I did in 2 hours
Okay so let me recap on what I've done for the past 2 hours:
I'm internet famousüòõ 
@LuffyzMonkey The rfc lore is that he's gay, that's it go touch grass
"No it ain't me because you cherry picked some designs and logos from companies with like hundreds of other designs for clothes. 
While you only have a handful and they're all the same thing. "

Muta has such a meme-able face 
@LuffyzMonkey I GOT THAT HORSER ON ME
"Dawg i already finished and left my social studies class 20 minutes in. 

It's a 2 hour class."
@LuffyzMonkey i didn't get the context to this until i realized someone messaged me saying they were a he instead of she. I don't think you need to put yourself down for a mistake as simple as this, though.
RT @LuffyzMonkey : Ngl didnt expect people to actually want me to post this. Anyways OFFICIAL AUGIE CAM MADE BY ME 
Everyday that guy doesn't follow me, it's a massive L on me 
RT @IziSenpai : My ex sent me this long depressing text wanting me back and I told her to touch some grass

Waking up to all this John Swan shit was interesting to say the least
I mean I think its a little funny that John was trolling HarleyTBS the whole time, but it's sad that he had to lie like this. Now he lost credibility and trust from the commentary community
Okay so in a delete tweet, I said that the drama was gonna end with John Swan confessing that he did it and dream looking like a cuck, and I was right 
@vichoparrapavez Where's the French girl interview?
"I made this ssj2 gohan sketch and it really took me back to last year when I started to draw more.
Looking back i improved way more than I thought I did "

@MrBadOptics Huh, there aren't really any place that I really would like to visit. Maybe Japan, but that's about it
Okay this is my first time doing digital art in a while, so I spent it doodling my sonic drawing from earlier

@vichoparrapavez @bowblax_s The only option.
I want Texas first! with AugieRFC 
@Amberoseone Such a good state man
@vichoparrapavez Yep
@vichoparrapavez it's not good, but it's not really bad. pieman's editing wasn't great, and a lot of his points were really bad and some stemmed from stuff he can't fully prove. one of his best points though was that john wrongfully said stuff like pieman was suicide baiting.
the pieman situation is cringe, the only thing i dislike pieman for is igniting this drama, but other than that, he did nothing wrong. john, ay star, and other handled this badly in my opinion.
@AugieRFC I win
@DJ_Screwdriver yeah
@Amberoseone fuck it reminded me of the chad going "yes" 
@MikeTheBike94 yeah we won't be ready because we're not prepared for something that's not going to happen

@IsnAkira Politics 
Yeah you know what, after reading the thread carefully, it's a bad take. Salty implies that it's the streamers fault for using edgy humor when they get canceled for it.
Although you only need to be funny to be a good comedian. Everyone always says "you can't be a good comedian if blah blah blah" but the only 2 things that would make someone a good comedian is that they're funny and that they don't need to explain the joke or hide behind satire
I can't tell if this is a good take or a braindead take, but I'm gonna say it's a good take if this isn't talking about anyone specific.

i'll try"

@Lilmaneyt a mark on the community like the mark on your pillow
99.5th percentile in terms of active twitter accounts isn't hard. If I tweet more on my main and get to I reckon ~5000 followers I can get verified.
I don't just want verification for bragging rights or stuff I actually get impersonated so it'll be helpful lol.
If I grow my twitter a bit more I think I can get verified. The verification requirement is "follower count in the top .05% of active accounts located in the same geographic region.", as I am Australian it should be easier because no one lives out here lol.

@Lilmaneyt @Krazzf @GayAreZee you guys are cringe sometimes but you're epic people who i consider friends. Keep up the funny tweets but try and tone down the cringe lol
@jadeechonn I've only really started to talk to you in the last few months, but by now you're one of my closest friends. You're always happy to talk to me when i'm not feeling great and you post funny tweets, you're all-round a good friend
@_AlexTheLoser_ in the time that I got to know you, you became a very good friend. We got into 10 hour discord calls and made up tons of inside jokes, you were always so fun to be around. It's sad you're gone and you're prob dealing with shit rn but i'll be here when you get back
@LtCythixYT you are the purest person in the community. While sometimes you can let things get to you, I always know your heart is in the right place every time and you always do what is right. You're also the only person who has 100% stuck by me through ups and downs‚ù§Ô∏è
@Sub2Michae1 what can I say, you're my best friend and you've always looked out for me. You've helped me out a ton, you're as good of a friend I could ever imagine and you're a beaming light of positivity in the community. I love you man.
I wanna make an appreciation thread I guess. Notifs may be annoying so if I tag you feel free to mute.
@Krazzf @jadeechonn it was a jew joke

anyone who does otherwise is not being honest and therefore a liar, that's my take"
@sinfullymyself oi mate
@Vampuffin or, they dont actually care about that shit
commentators have titles like "Jaiden Animations Rule34 is DISGUSTING" then have sexual art of her in the thumbnail to attract horny boys to click on the video

@sweetieisbad delicious
@LtCythixYT @Lilmaneyt yo
@Sub2Michae1 
@LtCythixYT nice!
@HarleyTBSYT I guess that's the world we live in. What's more depressing is that the real world is 1000% even more transphobic than Twitter.
@LtCythixYT @LtCythix_ well what is all this then lmao
Hey @LtCythix_ you deserve better 
"not joking
this goes deep"
Damn this video may be longer than I thought. It's incredibly likely the whole Crowder/Maza thing was part of a whole conspiracy relating to unions and wages at Vox.
@jadeechonn @realbuntyking 
@realbuntyking same bro
@StellaVindicta @realbuntyking and read definitions from

@GayAreZee i disagree. It can be, but the relationship probably won't work out.
@jadeechonn can relate
@HarleyTBSYT Same for you :)
@HarleyTBSYT I feel ya man, I feel the same way most of the time. Every day is a struggle but I try to push forward.
@HarleyTBSYT Why?
@sovietworker @sintiepop @sweetieisbad how is sintie problematic

@LtCythixYT sorry I'm not down for incest
@LtCythixYT jk
@LtCythixYT yo
@ItsBunaye tails 
@AVibewalker I disagree. As there is no medical way to "cure" dysphoria the best thing we can do is make people who have it as comfortable as possible. And it is ok.
@Lilmaneyt shall I not mention the Krazzf tweet then?
@Krazzf @RadsterrYT @BasedSerbian @jadeechonn @gamertrash14YT @LogicIsTaken @TiredCast @krazzfsmom perhaps you're giving out those signalsüôÑ

"@blaretelevision i still have based takes though lol
at this point idk if its internalized transphobia or if i actually believe it lmao (probably the latter)"
@blaretelevision i think as someone who doesn't identify with my bio gender i can provide my opinions on the subject
"in the future.
It is a mental illness but of course it doesn't invalidate them and they still are whatever gender they identify as.
But being valid doesn't mean not identifying with your bio gender is not a mental illness."
"Of course being transgender is a mental illness. It is biologically not normal and causes great suffering for people who are it. I wish and I'm sure many people wish they weren't transgender and it would be a good thing if somehow we could ""cure"" gender dysphoria
(1/2)"
@JalynIsHere Every step's a milestone.
@JalynIsHere I'm happy you've become confident in your gender identity :)
@BasedSerbian @jadeechonn she's right, it's cool
@JalynIsHere I love the profile pic
The Sting (1973) is such a good movie
People would accept non-binary people more if most of us weren't so goddamn annoying and retarded

"@OhMarDayz_ actually wasn't to do with him (although it also applies)
was thinking of Xplicit"
If you reply to someone's tweet criticising/disagreeing with them and then retweet your reply, you're cringe.
@CommentaryLs some of their content may be good but it doesn't make them not bitches
@ZaptieTheBear i hated jb and loved smosh
@ZaptieTheBear this is the type of meme i would have unironically loved back in 2012
@jadeechonn nah thats fine, i'm more talking about the people who obviously try to hide their face as much as possible
"im turning 16 in a couple hours
I want to be on call with some friends when the clock strikes midnight but idk if they're awake lol"
"show your face or don't

don't wear glasses and a mask and a hood to try and cover everything up, if you don't want to be seen then don't turn your camera on"

Two must be eradicated from the internet, which ones do you choose? 
@JohnSwanling @HarleyTBSYT Yeah this. Its very difficult if not impossible to really understand what people with mental health issues are going though if you haven't gone through it yourself
@CordWit I guess. And usually the big commentators themselves take criticism well, its the other smaller commentators who bash people criticising larger commentators.
@CordWit However Angelika is more of a tea channel than a normal "commentary channel" is she not?
it's literally hours long, so of course it'll take a long time to make
I am still making the commentary iceberg video, I'm just making this video in the meantime because I got a bit burnt out of writing tens of thousands of words for the same video
@OhMarDayz_ a lot of "small commentators" are terrible, but I do feel as if there is quite a bit of elitism
The only people who are "allowed" to criticize big commentators are other big/respected commentators. If you're anyone else you're just "clout-chasing".
@tatymaty__ no
lol the way i act online makes me look so right-wing but i'm actually not
@HarleyTBSYT It's true. People care so much about internet drama they forget there's a real person behind every screen.
@HarleyTBSYT The sad truth is that most people don't care about it because they don't understand it.

@alfieisntfunny @RadsterrYT 
@alfieisntfunny @RadsterrYT do you not know what a subtweet is? You called me out over subtweeting literally yesterday
@Cam_I_YT @Harrisingle @jakontrary lmao way more unbelievable than anything you've doubted about me
@alfieisntfunny @RadsterrYT It is about a subject that started because of my situation months ago. You agreed with a tweet that said what you thought I did was "fucked up"
Ironic that the people who "like to do a little trolling" are apparently blocking tons of people lol 
"I called out a bunch of small commentators for begging for a follow so they decided to non-stop attack me, lie to me to get me to get involved in drama, deceive people about my past, twist/take out facts and compare me to pedophiles.
lol at how fragile their ego is"
@jakontrary proof?
@jakontrary @Arlus @alfieisntfunny @DeeeTgg Nah I'm telling the truth. You can not believe me if you want but the truth is the truth
@DeeeTgg @jakontrary @Arlus @alfieisntfunny I didn't think of it for hours. I literally basically didnt think of it. I admit I shouldn't have sent it and should have thought more carefully.
"@jakontrary I know you're quote tweeting to try and get more likes or whatever to your tweets against me, you could have just replied, but anyway.
I was confused and didn't know what I was saying. I didn't mean that."
@jakontrary @Arlus @alfieisntfunny @DeeeTgg I wasn't thinking straight. Like I said I was confused and said stuff I didn't mean.
@DeeeTgg @Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny @jakontrary i wasn't thinking straight when i was writing those messages
@DeeeTgg @Arlus @alfieisntfunny @jakontrary i wasnt once i found out she was 12
@jakontrary @Arlus @alfieisntfunny @DeeeTgg I didn't mean that. Like I said I was sexually confused and I didn't know what I was saying.
@Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny @DeeeTgg @jakontrary I'm saying it was jokes that sort of turned me on in a way. It's not backtracking.
@Cam_I_YT @Real_aMac @_ThePieman_ I have said this before. Maybe you just weren't paying attention
@Arlus @alfieisntfunny @DeeeTgg @jakontrary I was 15 I thought she was 13, what's the big deal there lol
@DeeeTgg @alfieisntfunny @jakontrary by a 13 year old yea, what's the problem
@Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny @DeeeTgg @jakontrary It was jokes that sort of turned me on in a way. It was like the "grooming" jokes nowadays that people say.
@Harrisingle @alfieisntfunny @DeeeTgg @jakontrary correct
@alfieisntfunny @DeeeTgg @jakontrary BEFORE I found out her age. When I thought she was 13.
@jakontrary @Harrisingle @alfieisntfunny No I didnt.
@jakontrary What? I've said this many times before. I wasn't actually turned on by her at all once I found out she was 12. I don't see the problem.
@DeeeTgg @jakontrary @alfieisntfunny I wasnt turned on
@jakontrary @alfieisntfunny I made some poor word choices (I wasn't actually "turned on") because I wasnt attracted to her at all after I found out she was 12, but the sexual jokes exchanged before I found out her age did turn me on a bit back then so i was sexually confused
@fxckjayms the mother
@jakontrary @alfieisntfunny I made some non-serious sexual jokes when I still thought she was 13 (as did a lot of others), and then once I found out she was 12 I stupidly told her I was very disgusted and that I was sexually confused at what happened. I also made some poor choices of words.
@DeadMemeFrog @alfieisntfunny I agree. I shouldn't have subtweeted, and I provided names once ALFIE called me out on it.
@alfieisntfunny yeah mention me by name next time instead of subtweeting. Also I never sexted her, stop spreading misinformation.

"@DeeeTgg @Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny ""we both know"" lol no you're just making up shit

""we both know"" you're an idiot"
@alfieisntfunny @DeadMemeFrog Okay, I admit I should have clarified that some people I talked about only do some of the things I mentioned. I admit that. Sorry if you were upset at that or whatever
"@DeeeTgg @Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny They do. I can criticize people I don't like without a big reason why.
I said I don't like PewDiePie's newer content yesterday, was that interaction farming?"
@alfieisntfunny @DeadMemeFrog You do other things I mentioned though. I wasn't saying the people I mentioned do everything I said, I said some of the things.
@DeeeTgg @Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny i find his content boring, that's it. It's not a whole exposed thing I was just voicing my unpopuar opinion.
"@alfieisntfunny @DeadMemeFrog But you do some of the other things I mentioned in the tweet. I was just listing a few things which people in your friend group often do.
This is why I didn't want to name names, but you pressured me to."
@Cam_I_YT @DeeeTgg @alfieisntfunny So? It came to my mind. Why would I need to wait for something to happen to criticise someone's content?
@DeeeTgg @Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny I critiqued him because I don't like his content. Have you ever considered that as a possibility?
@alfieisntfunny @DeadMemeFrog I was generalizing your group of friends, whom many do.
@alfieisntfunny @DeadMemeFrog I wasn't talking about you specifically I was talking about a lot of people in your group of friends
"@DeeeTgg @Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny ... I'm waiting
idk where you got that idea lmao"
@alfieisntfunny @DeadMemeFrog I don't interaction farm or beg for attention from big creators.
"@DeeeTgg @Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny No I wasn't?
Give me any proof whatsoever."
@DeeeTgg @alfieisntfunny In fact his opinions I would say is even more of a feature than him just reading out someone else's stuff like in a BWC video.
@DeeeTgg @alfieisntfunny I don't think that's true.
@alfieisntfunny @DeeeTgg I don't think that is most people's opinions. You guys are the only people I've heard that from. In my opinion, a long interview with someone's opinions is enough for it to consist a feature.
"@DeadMemeFrog @alfieisntfunny good for you
I don't."
@DeeeTgg @alfieisntfunny No you don't
@DeeeTgg @Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny I think accusing anyone who criticises someone else of "just wanting a block" is stupid. I said I'm not a fan of him, that's it.
"@alfieisntfunny @DeeeTgg He does say his opinion on a topic, just without his voice.
As an example; EmpLemon does the same as I did here: "
@DeeeTgg @Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny not at all, I think TRO is a nice guy and I even told him that in my reply to him.
@Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny how
@alfieisntfunny I think that 5 paragraphs of an interview is enough to consider him having a part in the video. Other large youtubers have done the same thing before.
@DeeeTgg @alfieisntfunny He was there, his voice just wasn't in it. You don't need someone's voice for someone to be in the video
@Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny Am I not allowed to voice my opinion on a creator?
@alfieisntfunny I know cobra made that shit point and you all go with what he says cause you're buddies but the "i clickbaited clown" thing is pretty stupid lol
"@alfieisntfunny I put ""featuring colossal"" because I had a 5 paragraph interview with him. Like I said, you don't need someone's voice to be in a video for them to be in it.
Again: You DON'T need someone's voice to be in a video for them to be in it
And I don't interaction farm lol"
I agree with this take and always have. 
@alfieisntfunny Then when have I ever acted like I'm better than anyone else? I criticized you guys over acting desperate for attention if that's what you're talking about.
@alfieisntfunny I have criticized others before, that is true. But that's not a problem because all commentators including you criticize people too.
@alfieisntfunny I'm no better than anyone else and I've never said otherwise.
muting all these drama conversations 
@Arlus what? i talk about commentary a lot. Yeah I'm a commentator lol that's what i do
"@alsike_xiv @ononoris @alfieisntfunny he was in the video, voice doesn't need to be in a video for someone to be in it

and i want to see this ""nuclear"" evidence"
@jakontrary @alsike_xiv i dont beg for follows
"@alsike_xiv @ononoris @alfieisntfunny my collab had 5 paragraphs of an interview. Like I said you don't need someone's voice for it to be a collab.

Where's the evidence of me going for the popular opinion, I want to see. Also I'm known for often going against the popular opinion so why would i do that"
"@alsike_xiv @ononoris @alfieisntfunny you don't need someone's voice in your video for them to be in it

i changed my john opinion only after i found out he lied

i don't interaction bait"
"@alsike_xiv @ononoris @alfieisntfunny how am i obsessed with clout
i want to hear it"
@ononoris @Taps77w so you dont want to mention how you guys tag some big youtuber in a tweet begging for attention and get all your friends to rt?
@alsike_xiv @ononoris how
@alsike_xiv @ononoris true
yeah lol talking about alsike, jako, alfie and associates if you couldn't tell. thought it was obvious

@ZaptieTheBear @Child_Groomer
@MenguinPan @jakontrary @MomentsTweetor are you this desperate?
"@DeeeTgg i'm not solely focused on what will give me success/relevance and will do anything for it
that's the big difference"

@DeeeTgg not at all, there are a lot of differences pal
@CablZone ü§î
@DeeeTgg just making sure they know i know what they're doing
@StackziesYT yeah dw i have the same thing sometimes lol
@jadeechonnart think of the people most desperate for any relevance they can get
@jadeechonnart a particular group of small commentators who do what i mention in the original tweet.
@jadeechonnart isn't it obvious
@HayleyAutumnLad you're not who i'm talking about
@TiredCast nah you're all good
you think no one notices lol?
@ZaptieTheBear nah i'd say 6
Dear the group of small commentators who all retweet every single one of each other's tweets, jack each other off, act better than everyone else and will desperately do anything to get a bit more relevance: ur a bunch of fags lol i know what you're doing

@GayAreZee hi

@CommentaryLs yeah so what lol i can't say a celeb is hot?
@CommentaryLs but she's hot

@michae1wastaken @jadeechonnart she's a 7.5/10 for me, but i would do anyone above a 2/10

@krazzftoo what happened?
"be yourself" is such cliche advice, but its something most commentators really need to take in
@mschneider2005 you don't even need to be religious to appreciate bible verses. Some of the bible is great advice no matter your beliefs.
@FridaysOVPyro yes
i'm seriously considering this
lol i should make a video titled something like "dream next minecraft manhunt leaked" and the actual video's just me shitting on dream and calling his fans retards and saying the n word
@michae1wastaken it begins.
"who cares" is not a proper response to criticism of your content

@fultsex at the time making it public didn't look like a bad idea. It was reasonable to do it. Hindsight is 20/20
"Why does karl even have any stans? He's the least funny, most boring member of the Mr Beast crew

@LtCythix_ lol its a tommy c quote
@fultsex Look you dipshit, instead of attacking my friends who thought one of their closest friends was literally dead, why don't you be glad that arz is ok like the rest of us. We made sure he was alive and he was so I don't see what anyone did wrong.
i'm also gonna make topic commentary on my channel, but only when there's a big drama and it'll be more pyro/slazo-like than gameplay commentary

@Real_SolarYT too soon
@unovaIia @DoktorSkippy bruh he's not even the biggest iceberg channel 
every video on the predator poachers guy has been about him being "racist" rather than him using real minors as decoys, something actually bad
Clarifying, he has been very irresponsible and unprofessional dealing with serious situations and that is very critic sable. I'm just saying the main focus of the criticism should be over that rather than some unfunny edgy jokes. 
@NotBobbyMcBro Agree completely, he's acted really unprofessional at times, but that should be the main criticism rather than the jokes.
@FridaysOVPyro no one has 'the right' to be angered over jokes
@FridaysOVPyro Yeah he was unprofessional with the EDP situation you can totally criticize him over that. But the main thing people are shitting on him over is the jokes he made
"i mean... was Chet Goldstein really that bad? He made some unfunny edgy jokes so what
he caught EDP that's way more important than making some prank call or a pedo joke lol"

@DeeeTgg then that's an unrealistic situation. Racists aren't a pokemon who say 'nigger' every 5 seconds
@ginneanvb a ratio means that you are taking the unpopular opinion. I'm glad to be brave enough to express my unpopular thoughts :)

@KrzearYT like if you can't criticise someone who won't change then the topic commentators you're defending will all be out of a job
"@KrzearYT i mean i agree most arguments against topic commentary is shit but...
With the ""who cares, they won't change so why criticise them"" thing, couldn't you say the same about topic commentators and that vegan teacher?"
"gonna be honest
LtCobra was one of the best commentary channels on the site when he uploaded frequently. It's some of the funniest content I've seen."
@OhMarDayz_ @ZaptieTheBear @Real_SolarYT @plate_hog @Weezisyt not letting them out
@GayAreZee I agree, it doesn't make much sense.

#GoodGuyKeem Keemstar has done nothing wrong whatsoever in his long history as a YouTuber. Everyone who has said anything negative about him is a jealous lying clout-chaser.
@notjadeechonn Blaming harassment on the victims? Pretty shitty on their part.
@notjadeechonn it baffles me how its so accepted. Most men don't even know about that shit going on
@GayAreZee i literally don't know
@notjadeechonn yeah idk how girls handle being harassed like that
@notjadeechonn üíôyou're doing great
@notjadeechonn disgusting

@ZaptieTheBear i want to hear zaptiethebear's intelligent political takes lmao
@Vampuffin @ZaptieTheBear nah i'm fine
@Vampuffin @ZaptieTheBear maybe, idk i'm just quite depressed from living here where i hate it and i'm so lonely that's why i've depended on the commentary community
@ZaptieTheBear @Vampuffin i dont like anyone here anyway and even if i did i wouldn't want an interstate relationship
@Vampuffin i won't edate. I've seen friends do it and it never works out
@ZaptieTheBear @Vampuffin i moved state about a year ago and in ~8 months I'm moving back to live with my grandparents because i hate it so much here so why talk to people if I'm just going anyway.
@Vampuffin its more complicated than that, it's kinda difficult to explain
i always feel like i think people are close friends when they don't feel the same way back
@LtMayhem i mean it says it on wikipedia 
wait so what happened with that ice poseidon 13 year old situation a couple years ago?
how do people have that much time to make videos? I wake up, get ready for school, go to school, eat dinner, do my homework, have like half an hour of free time then its my bedtime

@lleah101 @sadlyitssoph_ I agree, but also you can enjoy someone's content even if they have done bad stuff.
@Lararippp @lleah101 @sadlyitssoph_ carson had a 2 year age gap, it's literally not an issue
@OhMarDayz_ @plate_hog the joke is quite overused by now
@lleah101 @sadlyitssoph_ To be fair, the problem a lot of people have with James is the sheer amount of people he didn't know the age. For Pyro is was one, which is bad but can be excused as a mistake. With James Charles though, there are so many.
Commentary youtubers are just guys who make videos. That's cool, but don't act like they're anything more.
@jakontrary i needed to ask him for something in DMs
time zones are the worst
@jakontrary @ItsJaystation 
"@jakontrary @ItsJaystation no make this happen

@Taps77w Well I guess it's a positive that you don't have constant mental breakdowns
Would it be possible to get you on my podcast for an interview @NickJFuentes?
@jakontrary @ItsJaystation doubt

"@ZaptieTheBear its 1
COEFFICIENTS PEOPLE!"
"@jakontrary nope
"
@jakontrary wasn't that theturnz?
@mann_hydra yes
My videos about commentary drama probably won't get much views, so luckily I have videos on Keemstar, Steven Crowder and PewDiePie coming up to actually boost my channel lol
@JohnSwanling I know they're not edgy, but Mindcrack &gt; every other minecraft group
In my experience that's a pattern I've seen a lot of. Which is why I often find it harder to trust those sorts of "clean", "pc" people.
Sometimes the edgiest people are the genuine ones who are honest and nice and the "clean", "pc" people are the snakes who have something to hide, who will do anything for their own benefit.
my goal is to become the largest commentator without any fanart
maybe facecam stream on second channel tomorrow doing youtuber impressions

@Bowblax you already beat him in weight, now you have to beat him in subs
@KrzearYT Well that's not exactly what I mean. I'm more saying there's no reason to get angry at someone over making content you dislike, as people have different tastes in entertainment.
@MediocreCommen1 i don't get angry over not enjoying it, also i'm fine with topic commentary
@Arlus i'm thinking a light to decent 6 
@alfieisntfunny 
"@JohnSwanling @DavidplexTalks Most of it I see is ""you make too much vegan teacher/dream videos"" or ""you make low-effort videos"". Both of which don't really matter.
Yeah effort doesn't make a video good. A funny topic commentary can be just as good if not better as a long video essay."
@JohnSwanling @DavidplexTalks Some is shit criticism (the "too much vegan teacher videos" and "low-effort" criticisms come to mind), but some is valid.
"@JohnSwanling @DavidplexTalks Sometimes criticism is valid. You can't argue with that.

But I do see some people have an irrational hate for topic commentary that may arise from some form of jealousy."
@Jako_LIVE @jakontrary i mean the support following the john swan shit did help me out but i was gaining subs before from my soph video

RT @acidmais : Jake paul can't beat ksi.
Making topic commentary may be an easy ticket to success now, but any second YouTube could patch the bug and you could struggle to retain the same growth.
Like Lets-Plays and Reddit videos, all easy-to-make daily content that gets tons of views eventually is affected by an algorithm change and dies out.

you may not personally enjoy topic commentary, but why get angry at the people who make it?
If you pay attention, there are several sub-communities within the commentary community. The boundaries are quite fuzzy and people obviously regularly interact with people from different sub-communities, but certain groups are noticable.
maybe they'll find out he's not a real doctor
"Turkey Tom (a bird), collabed with Nick, then he was bombarded with hate from Pyro fans.

John Swan (a bird), collabed with Nick, then he got caught in the Dream lie.

DoktorSkipper (a bird), collabed with Nick, what happens now?"

@sadlyitssoph_ you look sunburnt
drama time today
@ZaptieTheBear whose ear?
@jadeechonn I guess some people consider it cringy. I don't care much either way, but I think its a topic where both sides have some merit.
*bio
I myself can see the point in cis people having pronouns in bio, I'm just annoyed at people who misrepresent others' arguments.
When people complain about pronouns in bio, obviously they know they have pronouns. The argument is usually that cis people don't need to state their pronouns in their bi, not that "no one has pronouns", a complete made up strawman argument.

@PunishedDef @Taps77w finally, today is my day
@jakontrary depends, there may be a situation where it is necessary
@JohnSwanling @DavidplexTalks I meant that I hold everyone to the same standard when I criticize them
@JohnSwanling @DavidplexTalks I hold you, Pancho and any other youtuber to the same standard
@JohnSwanling @DavidplexTalks first one is in quotes so he's quoting the person in the video, idk if morgz did respond but if morgz didn't, then pancho shouldn't have lied.
"@JohnSwanling @DavidplexTalks lying is not exaggeration
you said something that was not true, you didn't make something appear more important or greater than it is"
RT @jakontrary : 
"@mschneider2005 Sperging ‚â† venting

@RyzeonD yeah I barely talk about Toxix because he's only does what he does for people to get upset. Like I thought from LITERALLY the second I met him in June last year, he's just a troll.
@HarleyTBSYT it depends on the situation. A smack on the butt if you don't clean your room is different from constant physical abuse
@jakontrary sadly he deleted he best one
@FastingVynx I agree but the way you said it didn't make it clear it was a joke
@FastingVynx I still disapprove of homophobic/transphobic comments like this post however. I just won't dislike someone I like or "kick" someone out of my community just because of it
@blaretelevision I do agree it doesn't look the best
"""i don't want transphobic people in my community""

why? they're still gonna be transphobes whether they're in your community or not, all that does is make your audience smaller"
like, its just people on the internet why should i care if some opinions they have are stupid?
i'm not transphobic/homophobic/bigoted myself but i honestly couldn't give a shit about whether my fans or the people i like are.
@iMARQ6 no, poor lighting
@dutchplacehold1 @alfieisntfunny Yes and the Eastern Orthodox Church is incredibly influential and is the official religion of Russia.
@alfieisntfunny this is why the map of countries where homosexuality is criminalized is mostly made up of Muslim-majority countries, as most Muslims in Muslim countries are quite radical (Muslims living in western countries are usually moderates) 
"@alfieisntfunny People who take the Bible or Quran literally are homophobes because both those ""holy books"" are homophobic.
That doesn't excuse them of course, I'm just saying the religion itself is the cause for this and its another reason why religion is retarded"
"RT @_ThePieman_ : It seems somebody wants stricter harassment policies huh...
Now remember again, how did that turn out for other sites which have tightened those sorts of rules such as YouTube? "

@GayAreZee Also I'd say TheGamerFromMars is the best researcher in the community
@GayAreZee I didn't say research is everything.

@ItsDrDemonic I'm way too high up imo but thanks
@CablZone @sadlyitssoph_ 
@sadlyitssoph_ Because misgendering is offensive if it invalidates what you identify as. Cythix's tweet doesn't because it doesn't challenge your gender identity.
@sadlyitssoph_ The reason trans people get offended (justifiably) is because people actually insist unironically they are a gender they don't identify as
"@sadlyitssoph_ he was joking
Also everyone knows you're a girl, no one thinks you aren't so I don't see what's so bad about this."
i mean she's clearly a girl and everyone knows it, Cythix doesn't actually think she's a boy
"Context:

there's a difference between using wrong pronouns to actually say unironically ""you are this gender you don't identify as"" and jokingly saying you're a guy as a meme "

@jadeechonn Good, but a little tired. How about you?
@jadeechonn good morning
don't worry i have some amazing people helping to edit sections so it wont take too long 
@GayAreZee I'm editing my part (~40 min) first, which I'm almost done. Then I need to write the rest (I'm really quick at scripting so this wont take long) and split the audio file into ~15 min sections for people to edit.
iceberg video part 1 probably going to be 2-3 hours long

@HarleyTBSYT @dutchplacehold1 I'm not excusing anything and what they did is 100% wrong. But the reality is (sadly) that making less of those jokes may prevent some of this from happening.

If u can make videos you like (whether they're the best they can be or not doesnt matter) while also getting views and money then W
@acidmais Yeah obviously its good to get money and views and stuff. But solely doing whatever you can for more views, ignoring everything else, will leave you tired of making stuff you don't like

@GooseGary2 lol I don't care about this account
@GooseGary2 Name one thing I've just "gone against the popular opinion" for for the sake of contrarianism. E.g. in a tier list from last year November I put TRO in C, all my opinions are my own.

@CythixYouTube @BasedAreZee Well always remember that no matter who shits on you, the people who care about you listen to you and know how great of a person you are
@GooseGary2 i think topic commentators and video essayists should stop fighting each other and just make entertaining content
There are many things to criticize topic commentators on, but the two most often said are simultaneously the weakest; making tons of videos on the same people and being "low-effort"
in 2019 every video essayist commentator made a Slazo video, so I don't think they can accuse topic commentators each making essentially the same videos on That Vegan Teacher of being "unoriginal"
"I can sort of understand why Dream feels so protective of his stans in a sense (even though I still disagree with him on it). 
It would be something really strange but comforting for millions of people to care so deeply about you and I think Dream has got sucked into this."

@2__roman Good editing can make a good video great but can't make a bad video good. That's my view
50 year olds preying on 16-17 year olds aren't just "creeps" or "perverts", they're PEDOPHILES
@DrDre4mTV Yeah I was kinda talking about people who solely judge videos off how good their editing is, ignoring al other factors.
cars 2 is unironically one of my favourite pixar movies
"@DrDre4mTV Topic commentary is not usually scripted.
A video essay can be perfectly fine with just normal cuts instead of super over-the-top transitions and hundreds of hours in after effects."

@GooseGary2 @jakontrary Exactly, that's my point
@alsike_xiv Someone mad I called daddy TRO badüò¢
@jakontrary Many videos don't need good editing. E.g. Mutahar, diesel, cr1tikal
@GooseGary2 I agree but you can have a good video without good editing.
@OhMarPriv @jadeechonn i was talking about cartoon characters from shows
@DeeeTgg Genuine. I dislike his content.
Friendly reminder: Editing isn't actually that important for a good video.
@alsike_xiv Nope! Criticize me on my editing all you want but my writing was well done for that video and I stand by that. There was no filler apart from some jokes I threw in which added some humor.
@alsike_xiv This is the problem with lots of you editors, you think editing is the most important thing. Nope! Writing is.
"@alsike_xiv ""Powerpoint presentation"" huh? I know what you're talking about now, editing!
Editing isn't the most important thing lmao. A good video essay doesn't need super-high effort editing to be good. In fact my favourite video essayists (Turkey Tom and EmpLemon) don't have 10/10 editing"
@alsike_xiv I know you're quite literally on the payroll but you don't have to simp this hard lmao
"@alsike_xiv I didn't make it double the length it needed to be, everything I said in the video was needed to fully complete the narrative.
TRO videos drag on for hours repeating other people's research and being so boring no one can stay interested without doing something else."
@alsike_xiv I watch his videos and they are incredibly boring and badly-paced. I don't think what I said in my video was filler and also it is very interesting to me that most people say they like TRO's videos the best when they're not actually paying attention to itü§î
@alsike_xiv 
@alsike_xiv I disagree, it all added something. At least I didn't make a video where half of it is me playing someone else's video and making a comment every 5 minutes.
@_greenhaven_ @alsike_xiv i dont understand the joke
RT @MorePieman : 
@alsike_xiv Disagree. TRO has good research and editing but his pacing is downright terrible and it leads his videos to be absolutely painful to sit through.
@alsike_xiv i had better writing and pacing than any of TRO's vids
RT @Real_aMac : Happy good friday

@jadeechonn I guess as background noise it makes sense. I like to watch videos with my full attention and I just can't finish a TRO vid.
@CythixYouTube yes

@jadeechonn that's fine, I'm more talking about characters from shows and such
@Krazzf @Real_aMac you dont get in by clearly begging for it
commentators stop using cartoon characters as profile pics challenge
@Krazzf its just reading one quote, so not a big feature like i said
cant believe i just got a (small) feature in the next video of one of my favourite history youtubers
I remember one of his videos played like 20 minute clips of someone else's videos in it with TRO just making a little comment summarizing what was just shown every 5 minutes
"his (i mean his editors') editing is great
his research is pretty good
but the writing is bad and the pacing is downright terrible"
@harrisingle no, too much exposition, not enough analysis
TRO is the most overrated commentator. idk how anyone can sit through his boring-ass videos
how are people still offended over 9/11 jokes, it happened 20 years ago, we're way past the point of "too soon"

I don't think this is any evidence Wikipedia is "sexist" or anything.
This seems less to do with current oppression of women and more to do with historical oppression of women. There are not as much Wikipedia pages about women because women were often kept out of professions in science, politics and sports. 
@TDPSBtv yeah i was that kid in 2018, always saying memes out loud to try and be funny
@BdankYT yeah you got me, but still I think there are very few exceptions to jokes

@calypso_live @lottasin oh 
@BdankYT I guess all jokes are okay unless they physically directly harm people or threaten people with harm in an unjoking way.
@calypso_live @lottasin what is dapping up and why do you want to do it to sin

@AckJigglen @Ramains_ i know what you said lmao
@AckJigglen @Ramains_ what
@Neoncaffeine Yeah, but I see people defending him saying he was just saying they're as bad as each other. But he consumes one anyway...
I'm confused on the Vaush CP argument. I get he's saying you can't be ok with buying things profiting off child labor AND be against cp, but since he does purchase things made using child labor, isn't be saying they're both ok?


RT @manipulatorgod : no offense if i was dating a commentary youtuber i would quite literally bl*w my fucking brains out

@aidinmp3 Yeah we need to make sure its not faked DMs
@Ramains_ All good bro, you're into what you're into! But tbh it is funny lol
face reveal 
Cancel culture strikes again. As a massive stan of Hitler, I can tell you this was clipped out of context from one of his streams. He was using pedophilia tactically to compare against how our culture justifies child labor. 
@twit_breezy @TheRealBlaxx cringe
Probably I'll make the iceberg video (although later on). Quite a few things on Skipper's video (e.g. the Idubbbz's real name entry) missed some stuff.
If you back down from arguing for something you genuinely believe is right for the chance of a shoutout or some subs, you didn't really believe in it in the first place.
A common misconception is that Leafy was banned for his Pokimane videos. He was banned after he had a Surreal Animations video which had a disturbing animation of h3h3 as his outro.
"why does every drama i get into have to be against someone respected lmao
just my luck"
at least i can start recording tomorrow
@DeeeTgg I know, I'm just saying I'm not gonna leave the internet
@DeeeTgg No lmao I'm not gonna leave the internet like some bitch who just lost an internet argument
idk if I'm even gonna make the video anymore, no matter how much effort I already put in so far. While I stand by everything I've said, this has just been mentally draining and I've gotten quite emotional from this.
@GooseGary2 i definitely won't lmao

@GayAreZee no comment
@VleasoTV @GooseGary2 why respond to a shit tweet like that
@GooseGary2 @VleasoTV im saying basically every tweet they are the first reply, not adding anything
@VleasoTV Yeah the people who are always one of the first replies to any big youtuber tweet, usually their reply is less than 6 words long as well, adding nothing
@VleasoTV Think about the people who reply "hi" to a youtuber posting "good morning" every single time. Those leeches annoy me (even though some of them are my friends).
@VleasoTV I have not
once you pay attention, you realize why some commentary channels have tons more followers than subscribers

I don't think its most Republicans however, more like a loud minority"
"@fl3xecutive I'm not rightwing, but I think the recent backlash against China is well-deserved. China is by far the worst country in the world at the moment and until now, they have gotten almost no criticism. That's not racist
Its like you can't say people criticizing Israel are anti-Semitic"
"@fl3xecutive Trump never said chinese people are the cause of the virus, he said China is. Him calling covid the ""chinese virus"" is not an issue because tons of other viruses have the name of where they came from in it.
Perhaps he could clarify better that he doesn't mean chinese people."
"@fl3xecutive Viruses have historically been named after the place of origin, it isn't racist. Spanish Flu, Ebola, Zika, etc.
Also China ‚â† chinese people"
*cough*pyro*cough*
@fl3xecutive China is heavily responsible for allowing the coronavirus to spread and I don't think calling covid the "china virus" is racist (even though I don't call it that), but blaming random asian people is just stupid and makes no sense

posting green simpsons every day until @EmperorLemon follows my main account @_ThePieman_ 
@JohnSwanling I agree it's unfair, I agree. I'm just saying YouTube says it doesn't punish creators for off-site behavior.
@JohnSwanling YouTube (at least apart from Onision and Crowder) applies punishments for rules broken on the platform. According to YouTube Leafy broke rules on YouTube whereas MiniLadd never broke rules on-platform.
@tatymaty_ How well they deal with criticism is irrelevant to the quality of their content.
@DoktorSkippy The best idea is to have some sort of a balance imo
@tatymaty_ I disagree. Done well, gameplay commentators can be way better than analytical or essayist commentators. It's all in the personality and effort at humor.
@JohnSwanling @acidmais No one is saying that. People are criticizing aspects of his content. I personally enjoy Maison's content, but people do have legitimate critiques.
@JohnSwanling @acidmais I agree, but giving reasons why someone's content is terrible is criticism. No one just says "ur content's shit".
@CythixYouTube @TheRealNoxlish @jadeechonn @StackziesYT ...
@acidmais that's not an argument, who cares if you make money off it that's not what people are criticising you for
@cnnbrk R.I.P, loved her in Arrested Development
@VexxSaysStuff no
@alfieisntfunny I mean my content could use improving and I want to try and make a name for myself outside of this drama, based off the merits of my videos. While I appreciate it, I didn't ask for the shoutouts and such, it just kind of happened, like how most people gain subs during drama.

@blaretelevision i'm not in any gcs
this guy is unironically saying tommyinnit is a child trafficker 
@Niftyylol libertarians cringe, they would argue a private company can do whatever they want without limits, including censorship
Freedom of speech is an idea, not a law. The first amendment only covers the government, yes, but the concept of freedom of speech can apply to private companies as well as a plethora of other things.
@Lilmaneyt blacks or jews, which are worse?

effort ‚â† quality
@5yb3r @Lilmaneyt But they do try to be entertaining. Try is the word here. I mean Jadyn literally told me he can't be funny in his videos because of "cancel culture".
"@5yb3r @Lilmaneyt No, because he tries to be entertaining and funny. I have spoken with topic commentators who have told me they know they make bad content, but it gets views. They purposefully make bad content.
Also adding ""durr"" to the end of your tweet just makes you look like a retard"
@5yb3r @Lilmaneyt Subjective things are worth discussing. All art is subjective but critical analysis exists.
@5yb3r @Lilmaneyt I'm not talking about effort, I'm talking about quality. They are not the same. A video with no effort can still have quality.
@5yb3r @Lilmaneyt also "you're just jealous" is a pretty shitty argument
@5yb3r @Lilmaneyt I'm not jealous lol, in fact I don't care if the video has 0 effort put into it. I like Mutahar, Optimus, Diesel and 2017 Pyro.
@5yb3r @Lilmaneyt I don't care about it being low quality, I like low quality stuff, I have a problem with them doing stuff ONLY for views.
@Lilmaneyt A topic commentator is usually a commentary channel which discusses a topic (not reacting to a video), usually over gameplay footage. The usually unscripted video consists of explaining the topic of the video and then giving their own opinion.
@5yb3r @Lilmaneyt No, because I've seen many topic commentators make that argument. I've seen discussions around this, I know what he means.
right now i mean
@5yb3r @Lilmaneyt He was. No one says make videos that don't get views, that's a strawman argument. People say "don't JUST care about views", which seems to be the argument lilmane is responding to.
@Lilmaneyt All art is subjective, it doesn't mean it can't be criticized. The Emoji Movie could be someone's favorite movie and their opinion is valid, but people can still have a discussion about the quality of it.
"@Lilmaneyt There can be a balance. It's not like you can either make bad videos that get views or good videos that get none.
You can make good videos that get views."
@Krazzf @Lilmaneyt Yes, and make good content that you and your audience enjoy
@Lilmaneyt I'm fine with people making things on a certain topic constantly, I do however have a problem with them making bad videos (which they admit to) and not caring about it since they'll get money no matter what.
@WisdomSalmon @SlushTV_ @thekinocorner to fight with imallexx while james marriott gets more and more uncomfortable and inabber probably gets dragged into the whole thing with him being kicked out of the eboys

@LtCythix_ @Lilmaneyt he's like 15 and most of the drama is stuff from when he was 13/14, it is really so bad that stuff he did at that age is too bad to forgive?
@LtCythix_ @JohnSwanling no, just no. His videos are terrible, by far the worst of the eboys
@LtCythix_ @Lilmaneyt idk why people dislike him so much, he seems fine to me
@LtCythix_ there's not enough good facecam commentators imo
@yeahdrinkmypiss @LtCythix_ Tell that to Pyrocynical or Nerd City

@OUT4CLOUT @LtCythix_ is anyone really a "leafy clone" anymore? that term died out in 2018
Saying "that's just your opinion" is meaningless. Like, no shit that's my opinion, everything's subjective. Something being an opinion doesn't make it any less valid of an argument.

honestly this seems low-key racist 
@DeeeTgg disagree, they're literal close friends in real life
glad in the last month colossal is starting to get some more respect in the small commentary community

"where u sitting at commentary middle school?
(can't sit with yourself) "
uhh... 
@AkameSpirit @rythril @Sub2Michae1 BriZ is definitely a great commentator
@rythril @Sub2Michae1 My favorite topic commentators are 2016 Pyro, and I guess present day Mutahar. You can tell with both of them they have a feeling of sincerity that is missing from many (not all) topic commentators today.
"@rythril @Sub2Michae1 I don't even think topic commentators need to ""innovate"", they just need to:
1. Don't pretend to care about things they don't care about
2. Actually be funny and entertaining, add some jokes
3. Be themselves (I know its cliche, but so many put on a fake persona)"
"RT @MorePieman : ""my audience respects me and i get views, what's the problem?""

"""my audience respects me and i get views, what's the problem?""

""morgz makes bad content, he bad"""
Many topic commentators say that if they are popular and respected by their large fanbase that's all that counts, yet continuously criticize other channels with even larger fanbases which respect them.
@Sub2Michae1 Totally agree, the problem is that a lot of what is getting ppular now is not good topic commentary.

@KrzearYT 
@KrzearYT Wouldn't really call you a topic commentator at this point, I'm more meaning the guys who make a hundred vegan teacher videos that all have the same point: "vegan teacher bad", without adding anything to the conversation
"Also I'd be happy to talk to a topic commentator on the Drama Time podcast this weekend because I'm honestly wondering how they can defend their content.
Most times they don't even defend the quality but say ""well it gets views"", no shit, that's not an excuse for the quality tho."
I'm usually someone who enjoys all types of commentary, from reaction to analytical to facecam, but the stale, absolutely terrible topic commentary that has gained prominence in the last ~3 months is really the worst commentary I have ever seen.
every guy deserves a girl who understands the complexities of commentary drama

@FarAwayPhantom I agree
@cyclonelmao raintism above turkey tom and nick deorio
@EthanCKelly It's a struggle we all go throughüòî
From my guess the style of blunt commentary popular in the community is probably more popular with males than females, its not a sexism thing, its just that different genders usually have different interests. Probably that's why most female commentators are somewhat tomboys.
I do sometimes wonder what makes the commentary community so white and more specifically male-oriented. I'm not gonna go into SJW shit but it does make me think about how our community's culture has made it this way.
I'm not usually the most "empathetic" person but I truly can get upset if my friends are. I always want to be a good friend and make sure they're happy.
@AckJigglen You didn't do anything wrong. What's the most important is you being happy and you being less stressed. You're a great guy and I hope you get better and can do what makes you happy. :)

@LtCythix_ What are you, scared?
@CringeInfluence Good. But as I said earlier, make a very unpopular video once in a while, it'll make you seem like you actually believe in your opinions.
@CringeInfluence So you can make a video stating your true opinions on Dream then?
@CringeInfluence So you're saying you should wait until you have the facts to make an opinion? Sounds like what you should be doing for any topic.
@CringeInfluence Nah just call him out when he does something wrong, its not hard.
@CringeInfluence I don't think so, Dream can be right in one situation and wrong in another. Nuance exists and if your audience is too dumb to understand, you need a better audience.
"@CringeInfluence 1. That's not even that unpopular
2. You can say it"
@CringeInfluence So you're saying you NEVER disagree with any widely popular opinions?
@CringeInfluence I'm not saying that you should defend her, I was just using that as an example to say that once in a while, you should have an opinion that is way different to every other commentator, because naturally people have different opinions so it would happen once in a while.
@CringeInfluence Honestly I would like to see an unpopular opinion for once, like someone defending the Vegan Teacher or whatever when everyone is attacking her or someone attacking a beloved creator when no one else is. If I want someone's opinion on a topic, I want an interesting opinion.
@CringeInfluence But why give your opinion if your opinion is the same as anyone else.
@CringeInfluence Your content is not informative if you regurgitate every larger channel's opinion out of fear of cancellation.
@CringeInfluence All of them changed and all of them are still not stale as fuck and unfunny, unlike you. Or maybe you just need an excuse to explain why your personality is so boring.
"@CringeInfluence You can be monetized and not be stale as fuck. 
You can be monetized and not be stale as fuck. 
You can be monetized and not be stale as fuck. 

How many times do I have to repeat this?"
"@CringeInfluence You don't have to swear to be funny (or edgy)
You can be funny and disagree with people as well as stay monetized
You won't get banned unless you're really edgy
You're the biggest fucking cuck on the platform"
@Commentary_OOC @LtCythix_ is he wrong though?
@CringeInfluence Don't give in anything. The "younger generation" isn't less edgy. 12 year olds spam george floyd memes in discord servers all the time. In fact the most sensitive people are the 16 year old pan non-binary shits who are older than your audience.
@LtCythix_ @CringeInfluence He's just saying he has to be unfunny and stale because "cancel culture" and I'm telling him that's stupid.
@CringeInfluence Then say it with the neopronouns shit. And be actually funny (you don't even have to be edgy to be funny) and say 'touch grass' if people get offended.
@CringeInfluence That is the opposite of what you said before. You complained about getting a tiny backlash for the MatPat video and you said you don't want to offend anyone because "muh cancel culture".
@CringeInfluence But it got 24k likes. So who cares? The whole point of expressing an opinion is that someone will disagree.
@CringeInfluence Your videos are NOT informative, its regurgitating the same opinions held by larger reaction channels which 99.9% of people agree with out of fear that someone will disagree. If you automatically take the popular side with every issue, why watch your content to be "informed"?
RT @MorePieman : @CringeInfluence You're acting like if you aren't an extremely stale creator who is unfunny (like you are), 'cancel culture' will delete your channel. Grow up.
@CringeInfluence You're acting like if you aren't an extremely stale creator who is unfunny (like you are), 'cancel culture' will delete your channel. Grow up.
@CringeInfluence You can keep your career and say stuff that is slightly controversial.
@CringeInfluence You will keep your career if you said the n word, you just have to not care about it. You make your fans, your fans don't make you.
Making a video where you disagree with part of your audience on a topic is not "cancel culture".
@CringeInfluence I'm edgy as fuck and I don't think Leafy was funny.
@CringeInfluence You don't have to know LeafyIsHere to like edgy content.
@CringeInfluence Your fans disagreeing with you is NOT being cancelled. Also Diesel isn't even political in his videos. And as well you can be edgy and non-political.
@CringeInfluence LOL younger audiences are some of the most edgy. You're not making content for them with permission from their parents, kids love edgy humour.
@CringeInfluence If someone loses respect for you because of some opinion you have, then you deserve a better audience. Don't bow down to stans.
@CringeInfluence Also many people who are ACTUALLY edgy have a career in the same style of content as you such as Diesel Patches or Gundam.
@CringeInfluence Saying "neopronouns are cringe" is not edginess. It's an opinion. Edginess is pushing boundaries to break norms for humorous or satirical purposes. You are simply expressing an opinion that some people disagree with.
@CringeInfluence You are allowed to. In fact it's quite a popular opinion, there's just a small annoying minority who disagrees. This isn't cancel culture, it's just people disagreeing.
@CringeInfluence You can disagree with your audience respectfully, and if they leave, you're probably better off without that audience.
@CringeInfluence This is why most gameplay/reaction commentators are so stale nowadays. Every one has the same easy opinion "poki bad" "vegan teacher bad" and they are too afraid to actually have opinions on anything slightly controversial.
@CringeInfluence Also saying "neopronouns are cringe" isn't 'being funny', it's just an opinion.
@CringeInfluence who cares
Also if you're not funny and you're a reaction/gameplay commentator, then your videos are most likely shit.
@LtCythix_ @GayAreZee @CringeInfluence @Pantherz45 @JadynIsBanned @PrisonMateLuke @TheBrettBurnz You're not deflecting criticism, but imo it's not a good style lol
"The reason i'm not funny is cancel culture" 
@GayAreZee @LtCythix_ @CringeInfluence @Pantherz45 @JadynIsBanned @PrisonMateLuke @TheBrettBurnz I don't see how those two points have anything to do with each other.
@LtCythix_ @CringeInfluence @Pantherz45 @JadynIsBanned @PrisonMateLuke @TheBrettBurnz Not all of them. In fact the videos of yours I like the most are the ones with a proper structure and flow.
@LtCythix_ @CringeInfluence @Pantherz45 @JadynIsBanned @PrisonMateLuke @TheBrettBurnz I know how you structure your videos. Also if you are indeed criticizing all these commentators for completely different things, it makes it worse in some ways, as it sounds like it would be a bit clunky, like smushing 3 critique videos into one.
@LtCythix_ @CringeInfluence @Pantherz45 @JadynIsBanned @PrisonMateLuke @TheBrettBurnz *bad research, not bad editing
@LtCythix_ @CringeInfluence @Pantherz45 @JadynIsBanned @PrisonMateLuke @TheBrettBurnz What most people criticise about Luke though is not "him being on a high horse", but false accusations and bad editing. If you have a video where you mention both as "bad commentators", people will inevitably assume things.
@CringeInfluence @LtCythix_ @Pantherz45 @JadynIsBanned @PrisonMateLuke @TheBrettBurnz I do agree. It's a bad idea to make a video on "bad commentators" as a blanket term. One on bad content and another on bad people/research would be better.

Yeah, no wonder he "apologized" to me right after Willy said he was gonna make a video. When questioned, John said to me he didn't even know Willy was making a video because he doesn't follow much drama, what a weaselly little liar. 
@2__roman That's my point, there aren't really any sites, I have to do the research myself.

@AugieRFC @BanishedJourno @_ThePieman_ "
@CommentaryLs @AugieRFC @BanishedJourno @_ThePieman_ Fattest L in the history of commentary right here.
After it was revealed John lied about the Dream stuff, I don't think I can trust the sincerity of his "apology" to me. There were a lot of really suspicious stuff with how he "apologized" to me, but I wanted to get this drama out the way so I let this go. I will reveal more soon.
@Real_aMac At this point, unless it was an elaborate bait by half the community, I'm sure there's evidence and it will come in due time.
The whole drama was stupid and boring in the first place. Commentators only made videos about it so they could have Dream in the title.
All I'll say on the Dream stuff is that I never took sides and I'm glad I never did.
@Real_aMac @HarleyTBSYT I agree, it doesn't seem like him. That's why if this is true then my entire view of him is changed and I may no longer be inclined to believe him on other matters.
@KrzearYT On the Reddit for Iceberg Charts I've seen quite a few good Minecraft ones you could take some inspiration from. Honestly I've been hooked on these iceberg videos lol, they're so interesting, even on subjects I wouldn't usually be interested in.

@Spooky_Banks I'm not saying the video's not boring, I'm saying based on just whether the videos are factual or not iDubbbz and Pyro's were the only ones who had some good criticisms.
@Spooky_Banks Pyro made many valid points in his. I admit he went too far with some of it and Keem definitely never doxxed him byut the French girl situation for example was all on Keem.
good or bad? 
@_Davidplex True, it wasn't really doxxing, but it was still shitty on Keem for exposing it to more people.

@KarmapockyD Yeah, I can still criticize him. He's better now though, but people act like 2016 never existed lol

I know Leafy has been "rehabilitated" in the commentary community but he was still a cringy as fuck edgelord who made repetitive videos and had no self-awareness.
@cyclonelmao I'm covering this in a video I'm working on but Leafy and Grade were just as bad as Keemstar in that situation.
@cyclonelmao True, but some shit they said about Keemstar was legit insane. Grade accused Keemstar of asking 15 year olds for nudes and of abusing his wife. Leafy also made really bad accusations with no proof.
Apart from the Content Cop and Pyro's video, every Keemstar exposed video from 2016 was filled with 90% rubbish.

@Sub2Michae1 Turns out he was 100% sincere the whole time. Just like I thought.
@KrzearYT I'm not sure. The big trend then was making people's subscribers go down (therefore decreasing watch time and ad revenue for youtube). Since YouTube changed the live sub counts it hasn't been much of a thing.
@jadeechonn 9 and 5
TikTok probably doesn't want drama. Same reason why YouTube banned live sub counts in 2019. 
"RT @TheRealJimsYT : Check out my newest video where I take a look at 20 hidden gems from modern Simpsons, with assistance from @mattselman and @itsnicktendo
"
2 likes and i'll stream
@acidmais Nice! Hopefully it'll lead to even more success.

Leafy had the same schtick over and over again and he wasn't even that funny. Pyro had good jokes, smart humor and gave insightful comments and was overall way better than Leafy. "

@Vampuffin You're not on the tier list template. But you're a cool dude!
Commentary tier list based on what I personally think of you based off my personal experiences (so only people I have actually interacted with) 
@jadeechonn Hope you get well :)
@Pimpin_Pete @BanishedJourno @_ThePieman_ 100% agree. Never argued with this.
RT @2__roman : I remember when we were in a call and I was telling you how I hated seeing you and other people succeed because of jealousy. You made me realize so many things about YouTube that I never realized before, and I am really great full for that. But congrats,an go jerk off to the boys 
@jadeechonn good

@Lararippp @aliceisbacc @_ThePieman_ So people will ignore what John did because of one comparison they disagree with? Pretty stupid
"@aliceisbacc @_ThePieman_ I disagree, I only compared ImAllexx and John's responses. I never said what John did is comparable to what ImAllexx did as well.
Also that is besides the point of the video. Try to focus on the actual points I make and not dwell on minutiae."
@aliceisbacc @BanishedJourno @_ThePieman_ Because both of your tweets can easily be answered by the same response.
@aliceisbacc @BanishedJourno @_ThePieman_ I compared their responses to their subjective dramas, not what they did originally. So I'm not saying what John did is remotely comparable to ImAllexx's wrongs, but their responses were similar in style and substance.

@Cumknowsrap i am charli d'melio
@munkealt @_ThePieman_ I'm confident.
@_ThePieman_ (obviously being sarcastic if you couldn't tell)
@Pridwynn @_ThePieman_ John fucked up more and he still hasn't apologized or taken responsibility. I have. That's the difference and he needs to be held accountable.
@Pridwynn @_ThePieman_ If Dream did this people would be making videos left and right.
@Pridwynn @_ThePieman_ I came close to killing myself. John made fun of it and said I faked feeling suicidal. People need to know.
@Pridwynn @_ThePieman_ But did I deserve to get harassed endlessly? Was John right for accusing me of suicide baiting with no evidence?
@Pridwynn @_ThePieman_ I'm 15. It was weird but not terrible. I also blocked her right after learning of her age (she lied about her age, saying she was 13).
@loafyyyyyyy @Pridwynn @_ThePieman_ Yes, it was weird. However i'm 15 and I didn't deserve to get harassed like I did. It's weird but not deplatform worthy. I never defended what I did, I said what happened after to mewas disgusting.
@Pridwynn @_ThePieman_ No, it was a 3 year age gap. Many people inc. Nick, Augie and WillyMac have defended me over this. After hundreds of people called me a pedophile and gave me death threats I came close to killing myself. John Swan then said I faked it with 0 evidence.
@Pridwynn @_ThePieman_ i do go outside + go back to sucking John's dick
@sutcoT @_ThePieman_ There's way more to the story than that. Watch the video when it releases.
@loafyyyyyyy @Pridwynn @_ThePieman_ do you expect every tweet I make to get every one of my followers to like it?
@loafyyyyyyy @Pridwynn @_ThePieman_ Over 150 people liked my announcement post last week.

@Lilmaneyt I mean its not like I'm offended by that stuff, I don't care about it, it's just not funny.
@Lilmaneyt I agree. Edgy humor is supposed to have an element of humor, its not just posting something offensive.
@Lilmaneyt He did it in a pretty stupid way. He has the right to express his opinion on the usage of the term but the way he went about the situation was a mess.

@LtCythix_ PewDiePie's channel is so large that if he uploads daily he is bound to get that much views. His channel has definitely declined during the last year (in views and imo quality), but even in late 2019 when he was getting 10M views per daily upload it was 10% of his sub count.
@LtCythix_ always surprises me the amount of little kids who watch commentary, even though I was 10 when I got into it
The biggest letdown in history was PewDiePie turning down Alex Jones' offer of hosting meme review.

@StellaVindicta @mitchell001 Yeah exactly, and then I end up seeing notifs of people arguing with the muted person. Just better to block them off completely lmao
Blocking people for giving you fair criticism is definitely shitty, but if people are just spamming your shit with the same thing constantly then I think you have every right to block the perpetrators.
My policy on blocking people has changed significantly over the past 2 years or so. In the beginning, I thought blocking people was kinda a pussy move. But as I got bigger I realised the only way to keep your sanity on this website is to block the morons out.

@roscoe_biggers @brentphoto_nyc @EllieSappho @ScottMGreer Putin is much better than this American Globalist Empire.
@brentphoto_nyc @roscoe_biggers @EllieSappho @ScottMGreer Yugoslavia was neutral on the geopolitical plan. Yugoslavia politically didn‚Äôt align with anyone. Even if she meant that she is wrong.
@ScottMGreer I will send this to every chick I talk to. (6'5 btw)
@roscoe_biggers @EllieSappho @ScottMGreer I don't trust someone that says Yugoslavia was a part of the Soviet Union.
@EllieSappho @ScottMGreer For someone at Harvard, yes. You should know that.
@burger_baba They fought for what they thought was right! You gotta support that.
@BasedSerbian The Three Kingdoms had a lot of internal battles too. They are also forgetting some of the battles the Chinese had with the Mongols.
@BasedSerbian They had a civil war from 1927 to 1949.
@thebestine @pissedtito @ScottMGreer What's wrong with the word femoid?
‚ÄúRecorded‚Äù just because Europeans stored records. Also, the China region is missing a collection of battles. You have to be naive to think this map is accurate.

Now to determine precisely how mankind impacts global climate change today is rather difficult, assuming it‚Äôs even possible.
It can be some minor Earth axis inclination or the orbit of its around the sun shifted, which can lead, historically speaking, to significant climate changes on earth. Those were colossal changes that led to dramatic consequences. Whether they were good or bad, they were dramatic
Nobody knows the legitimate reasons for global climate change. After all, we know such periods in Earth‚Äôs history when there were drops and rises in the temperature. It can be caused by some global processes in the universe.

@trollstah Italy is getting fucked by the EU hard. We are basically fucked. EU is a trap for a globalist agenda. You will learn with time.
"@trollstah Yes, I know your history. My statement has also been validated by yourself. 

There is nothing prosperous in being abused by the EU (I should know as an Italian)."

@BasedSerbian @gggglysh It will be the Slavic anthem when Putin gets all the Slavic country back to Russia.

"@BasedSerbian @gggglysh TITO WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG.

FUCK GLOBALISM!!!"
@gggglysh @BasedSerbian America First.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh I still think is the smartest economic move of the last century. A country needs to make itself not dependent on foreign countries. This will make these prices and wages go hand in hand instead of being controlled by foreign countries.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh The prices were extremely low, due to all of the products were made in Yugoslavia.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh Yugoslavia benefitted massively from being neutral. Both the West and Soviet gave trading options, while the Yugoslav people were quite low-paid, but the prices were extremely low. (A economic mastermove from Horvat)
@gggglysh @BasedSerbian We are talking about history, dear.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh Bulgaria was an extremely important country position-wise for the USSR. Also, the USSR didn't have the control they wanted in Yugoslavia, which is why they didn't allow Yugoslavia to take over Bulgaria.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh Tito wanted Bulgaria, but the Soviets didn't allow it. Bulgaria would have been a huge W for Yugoslavia. The idea of Yugoslavia for Tito was to unite all South Slavs.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh Misic did a lot work for soo many countries throughout WW1
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh The concept of Yugoslavia would never work as great Serbia. It needed to have a separate identity. Yugoslavia(South Slavs) was a genius way to create a country.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh I'm impressed that he came out as the biggest winner of WW1
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh Depends. Tito didn't show support to any of his colleagues which made it extremely hard to establish the next leader of SKJ. Yugoslavia needed a leader to unite the people for a longer period because Nationalism wasn't eliminated.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh Karadjordje dynasty was pretty bad tbf. Tito was extremely liked when he came to power. He was a marshal and a war hero for the people. Tito was like Putin for Russia today. He represented the country.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh Tito's main mistake was making federals/states and not having a successor. He should denounce all of the federals to stop nationalism.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh Economically not a communist. I legit adore the economic genius Branko Horvat. Tito was pretty hard against speech tho. hahah
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh Is extremely sad seeing Balkan these days. All of them act like nationalists but at the same time are packing their stuff, so they can move to Germany. Yugoslavia was a force in Europe, unlike these shitty governed countries.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh The main difference between the people from Yugoslavia is religion. I don't get how religion is playing this big of a role. You guys basically speak the same language and hate the same people, lol.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh If NATO was fair then they would have bombed both countries. The Yugoslavian Civil War was retarded on all parameters. Firstly, because Yugoslavia is made mainly of 3 tribes Carantanian, Serbs, and Croats (Slavic tribes).
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh The only time NATO did something, lol. Serbia didn't deserve it, but man some of the people in JNA did retarded stuff in Bosnia (Croatia also had a lot of blood on their hands to be fair).
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh The guy literally caused the Balkan wars while losing full control of Kosovo. The US even bombed the shit out of Serbia.

"Good morning fellow Groypers. For the people that missed @NickJFuentes appearance on the politics discord:

AMA: 

Post AMA debate: "
@JadenPMcNeil What the fuck. RIP.
"@EnglandWatts @NickJFuentes ""You are not a woman""

@TheQuartering Reddit is the epitome of mediocrity
"RT @NickJFuentes : Thank you to the mods on the Politics server for a very FAIR and respectful AMA. I will jump back into a voice channel shortly on that server to discuss with callers and stream it on Telegram!
"
Overall a very solid Fuentes' AMA on the politics discord. There was a little bit of everything (a veggie, a fed, and a tranny), which created a dynamic stream. We still need Fuentes vs Destiny pt4 soon.
Lol, Fed called into Fuentes AMA as a groyper. 
"Does the Zionist control the media?

*Discord interruption*

LMAO"
@punisheddogg The tranny tries to get a gotcha so hard. It was hilarious. He doesn't know Nick The Knife, lmao.

Tranny destroyed by Fuentes live on stream, lol. 
@nicholasdeorio @LilNasX Extremely cringe.
@vichoparrapavez Fuentes won 2 out of 3. The 3rd one is more of a conversation.
@vichoparrapavez They have debated 3 times already. It would be amazing if Destiny calls in. Nick said "It would be interesting talking to Destiny again".
@nicholasdeorio @RedFoxComms @realExate @LilNasX Most of them are.
@vichoparrapavez He is great. We call him, Nick The Knife for a reason.
@Dragunov_01 I will post a link tomorrow morning on my Twitter.
Nick Fuentes wants to debate Destiny on discord right now, lmao. I hope Destiny wants to join the discord.

I can't even imagine which state Russia would be in without Putin. They wouldn't be a superpower like they are now, that's for sure. Massive respect for Putin making Russia a superpower. Russia's middle-class is constantly getting bigger too.
RT @NickJFuentes : "Economic nationalism," and "working class populism" are not sufficient by themselves. There must be a Right cultural/identity component as well. Trumpism was not about just economics and you're not going to have Trumpism or anything more successful with this naive approach.

@H2Ofountains Made a mistake, what can I say. I got duped by the highlight.
There is a big group of non-believers that try to lecture us on our religion without reading the Bible. This perception of Jesus being a hippie that loves everyone is false, and it shows you haven't read the Bible.
"There are so many people that portrait Jesus as a hippie that loves everyone.

@burger_baba @DANSTER8 @NickJFuentes I like to go in with an open mind and seek the truth. I'm glad that you showed something factual about the Soviet Union being heavily influenced by Non-Europeans.

@DocOnTheRadio @RedFoxComms Optics. Connor has never made an anti-Semitic tweet. Prove me wrong!
@RedFoxComms FACTS. Twitter is a cesspool for satanism.
@burger_baba @DANSTER8 @NickJFuentes Thanks for the information. I didn't know this part. Is not something I have looked into before.
@burger_baba @DANSTER8 @NickJFuentes You are right that a good amount of the elite were non-Europeans in Soviet Union (Stalin etc.).
@burger_baba @DANSTER8 @NickJFuentes Russian are European. They are from the Slavic tribe called Antes which moved to Russia from Poland/Ukraine.
@TheJackoWraith @DANSTER8 @NickJFuentes They outnumbered Germany and won the war. We need to outnumber the Dems and win the election.
@DANSTER8 @NickJFuentes The Red Army won the war because they outnumbered Germany. We need to outnumber the Dems to win the next election. My comment about the Red Army is not about Ideology at all.
@DANSTER8 @NickJFuentes Glad you got the reference. You have to remember how successful the red army was in the second world war.
@NickJFuentes The red army will rise up!

@huntersayshi @disclosetv All of these were reported and well-known. The mistakes lately shows that we need to improve our standards.
@huntersayshi @disclosetv Where is the success lately? Hunter Biden's laptop was destroyed by the FBI. Was that a success?
@disclosetv FBI failing is getting more and more common.
My current mood about life: 
@RedFoxComms 
@MrBadOptics We are pretty well-trained if we need to be optical. Is clear that Augie hasn't be apart of Fuentes' chat. hahha
"@Ambrose_Rng 20% of the chat is elite trained by Nick Fuentes, which is why our optics are always in check.

60% are normies

20% are tea people, who are the edgiest ones in the chat."
@MrBadOptics I literally spammed "STOP WATCHING THIS" to him for minutes straight. It was inevitable that someone would drop the Hiroshima bomb.
Augie's optics was worse than the chat today. Augie playing that Alice video, tells you everything.
@Misatoish @Dragunov_01 @RedFoxComms Big brain.
@KhahkonenSZN I find it a little funny that Augie is one of the only ones saying that he doesn't care about the chat for the longest time but now is a problem. I don't have an issue with it, tbh. I have been educated to be optical by Fuentes.
"@SISssys_Art @basedinheaven2 You are sperging out, dude. Are you scared of going to hell? 

Catholicism is the only true religion."
@SISssys_Art @basedinheaven2 Why are you acting like the biggest sperg.

"RT @AetiusRF : Old: The shooter was white and was motivated by white supremacy

New: The shooter was Syrian and was a victim of white supremacy "
@disclosetv And that will solve nothing.
@ScottMGreer The worst part of the tweet is him not knowing anything about Navalny.
@ScottMGreer He was not white enough. That's my guess.
@Pressnia @MikeTheBike94 @RedFoxComms Same
@MrBadOptics Interesting point of view. I personally think my optics are been amazing lately.
@MrBadOptics I don't think Augie will learn us anything new. We are experts in optics.
"It looks like I have to enter my second re-education for optics. First Fuentes educated us (the chat) in optics, and now Augie will educate us (the chat) in optics.

Augie to the chat: "
Augie's tweets today. 
@LuffyzMonkey @RedFoxComms You are a filthy sinner.

@VikChatterjee @DarrenJBeattie Pakistan?? I don't think there are any Pakis in that crowd.
@sanjosepaleocon @1000TOASTERS @NickJFuentes Most likely that. You know that Twitter is watching him like a hawk to find a reason to ban him.

@nicholasdeorio Twitter is a shithole. I'm finding that out very fast. So many grandstanders on here is crazy.

@DarrenJBeattie Putin is a pretty awesome leader, indeed. Strong personality, which makes him respected all over the world.

@BasedSerbian @Taps77w @AugieRFC I know, I just love the colors more. Also, it has small crosses on it. All of the dynasties in Balkan at that time period at that kind of look. 
"@BasedSerbian @Taps77w @AugieRFC That's extremely epic and it makes a lot of sense. Thanks.

On another note, what are your thoughts on the Kingdom of Bosnia's coat of arms? It looks pretty epic to me. "
@BasedSerbian @Taps77w @AugieRFC That's great to hear. Why was Stefan Nemanja not Nemanjic? I have been thinking about that for some time. The same happened with the Bosnian Kingdom where Ban Kulin wasn't named Kulinic, which was the dynasty's name.
RT @CatholicGroyper : God &gt; ‚ÄúScience!!!!!‚Äù 
@BasedSerbian @Taps77w @AugieRFC That's great to hear. I think we all should know our own history.
@BasedSerbian @Taps77w @AugieRFC Just google Slavoj Zizek. He is pretty well known.
@BasedSerbian @Taps77w @AugieRFC Tito economically wasn't a Marxist. He was embracing his own set of economists that were extremely talented. Just read about Branko Horvat, who was the main reason for the economic uprise in Yugo. Horvat was the best economist of the 20th century. His work with Yugo was amazing.
@BasedSerbian @Taps77w @AugieRFC The Civil war was one factor to the economic decline of the Balkans. Even without the Civil war was Yugoslavia having a massive issue due to inflation, which was created due to the party not allowing the economists to work their magic, because everyone was preparing for war.
@BasedSerbian @Taps77w @AugieRFC He was a pretty epic man. Unfortunately, Balkan has fallen massive since his death.
@BasedSerbian @Taps77w @AugieRFC Fortunately he was

@BasedSerbian @AugieRFC Dusan really took Serbia to the next level under his leadership by taking over most of Greece and create the Serbian Empire. While Tito won the war in the Balkans without any help from foreigners and still managed to create Yugoslavia. A country that was respected by everyone!
"@BasedSerbian @AugieRFC Dusan was the most succesful Serb, while Tito is the most succesful Croat.

In my opinion, Tito still the greatest leader in Balkan history."

And btw you left out a lot of shit. Another reason as to why I don't accept the apology.
Small response to this. You should've apologized a long time ago genuinely but I will not accept this apology. Get off the internet and get some help, you need to improve yourself bc of how fucked in the head you are.

@JohnSwanYT @BanishedJourno The fact of the matter is it comes down to preference. People like to pretend we live in 2010 and the iPhone doesn‚Äôt have features like background wallpaper yet.

@BanishedJourno This is like asking Twitter if you should build your own pc. Their opinions are terrible, the iPhone is a super good handset.
I don‚Äôt want to throw out my entire Onision video but like he‚Äôs nearly faded entirely into irrelevancy so I almost think it would be counter productive?
@JesskaPizzle That‚Äôs what every single hot tub stream is and if you‚Äôre denying that you‚Äôre quite literally in denial
"Worse support**** typo

Anyways one last thing, I feel like this ‚Äúlook guy she‚Äôs breaking the TOS‚Äù feels similar to when people run to drama channels and say we ‚Äúharass people‚Äù. Idk, if no one is getting hurt I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd bother crying about it."
The same reason everyone is mad about Twitch‚Äôs female bias is the same reason why people are confused why Twitch made the worst possible response in this situation. The wide issue is a fucked up TOS, worse enforcement than YouTube, worse poor support than YouTube &amp; visible bias.

"The entire goal of metadata is to target a specific audience. My tweet is just questioning why there are people who consume incel content like this?

I have slept like 3 hours in 4 days and I just came up with the theory that iDubbbz wrote the Content Cop 2 on Keemstar and never released it. Then he gave it to Ethan Klein.
The problem with this project is that it‚Äôs literally 2 full length videos and I have no fucking clue why I did this to myself
@AugieRFC Rendering in parts and it‚Äôs a long wait. This video is like an hour and a half
@AugieRFC Late probably
Loved this video by Tom 
Yes the video is still coming today. Rendering now
@benjeuk Oh didn‚Äôt mean you specifically. It‚Äôs existed with time stamps to skip to. Very similar to my Twitch streamers video
@JayExci If you post more than one video they will call you a money whore. Having lots of thoughts is not allowed
@benjeuk I‚Äôm not to worried about length. It‚Äôs like 7 mini loosely connected videos so if you‚Äôre bored you can just skip to the next one.
For those asking why it‚Äôs 3 days long, the project was supposed to be 20-25 minutes. I‚Äôm well over an hour

@OvidiuRo7 @Bowblax Ask those people??
@OvidiuRo7 @Bowblax No I don't remember a YouTube comment live
Even the people who completely disavow all forms of edgy humor who may have been edgy themselves admit that they have made this type of racial humor in the past but when they describe it, they call their words ‚Äúmisguided and cringe‚Äù. For Keem it‚Äôs racist.
@PotassiumHoard1 My nuclear take for that situation is that I realistically haven‚Äôt spent more than 30 seconds caring about it.
Maybe a nuclear take however, I think the first post proves his point effectively and he doesn't need to go full Insider Jouno and pretend Keem's 2017 "Fiver Guys" WSJ joke was hateful in nature.
"Def Noodles paired a gotcha post with edgy jokes to try further paint Keemstar as an anti-Semite. 

I understand the tolerance/willingness to defend edgy humor has dissipated due to optics but at the very least removing Keem saying he was joking 3x is why people hate this guy. "

@MorePieman I agree that this is an issue most of the time. However, I myself didn‚Äôt get dislike bombed on my video I made on Keemtar when I had 1000 subscribers but I did get hammered on my Quartering video which had a 50% at release. I feel it varies.
@BanishedJourno It felt like the spiritual successor to Drake and Josh which was also a show I really enjoyed. I remember watching the premiere in 2007 lmao
Real talk it‚Äôs PG-13 rated and I‚Äôm psyched as fuck to watch this
Sam looks different 
For those who don't know, Ethan made an entire 20 minute highlight showing fake Drama Alert thumnails. 
Ethan Klein found Keemstar's "Unlisted Videos" so I went digging and found his PODCAST TEMPLATE!

@_ThePieman_ Congrats bro!
"@munkemoment I was on nicks live stream already disagreeing with some of toms points. In this same live stream nick called the entire pyro situation before it happened.

"@CommentCopped @BanishedJourno @_ThePieman_ If tipster is honestly apologizing, which I think he is, I think I‚Äôm cool with accepting it.

"@Bowblax @AugieRFC @CordWit Lol I think people are misinterpreting my tweet. I was just joking guys. Sorry if this was being read weird. 

I was expecting lol to be in the replies. This is not serious"

I just hope @CordWit can be a beacon of hope"
@NewsM101 @JohnSwanYT There‚Äôs literally more evidence of John being a sociopath than dream. All that guy did was cheat in Minecraft.
"@NewsM101 @JohnSwanYT No I didn‚Äôt miss that. What I said still stands

People should apologize if they promote (even accidentally) a false narrative against someone. 

John had so many people promote false narratives against Dream. Meaning that they should apologize to dream."
@NewsM101 @JohnSwanYT So you shouldn‚Äôt apologize when fooled into promoting blatant lies?

@BanishedJourno not discrediting, just checking the casualty number
@BanishedJourno did he lie about and throw as many friends under the bus as john?
"@ShanMark18 ""professionalism"" was a word in johns dms used to defend him. 

They said since John used ""professionalism"" in recent dms, the kid would have said that and used the same word. 

I was called retarded for saying that was nothing lmaoooo"
@_Davidplex This is the shit I'm talking about. fuck that. He doesn't even deserve this.

bruh i don't wanna hear your sob story."

Way to own up when its over."

This is my new hype man 
RT @UnreliableGarz : Ok maybe I am being too soft on John knowing he has been this harsh to a 15-year-old kid... "you cannot have a public platform" "haunt you forever online"... well.. ditto, Swan. 
Your apology can ligma  
@ShanMark18 John just admitted it.
@JohnSwanYT glad you're taking your own advice 
"@JohnSwanYT You're a fucking liar. 

You let my friends attack me.

And you refused to own up till you ABSOLUTLEY HAD TO.

I wouldn't be surprised if this was your manager asshole."
@CordWit I just think it's funny he let everyone rally against me and was happy about. Pattern of behavior. dudes character is shit.
@nicholasdeorio Dude sat by happy as a clam, while you and me went at it. Fuck this dude

Yo shocker. the dude lied. He willingly let me and my friends argue and was happy for it. 
@LuffyzMonkey ur name is interesting

RT @CommentCopped : where he go

"@nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision When did I say you were? 

All I said is that if it wasn‚Äôt John, this would be a bigger story. That‚Äôs my opinion.

Please don‚Äôt give me any long hypotheticals. You can call me if you want. This isn‚Äôt that serious haha"
@nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision Plus bowblax apologized and fixed it. John has only double downed. If John did the same as bowblax, I wouldn‚Äôt be talking about it
"@nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision Yes. I think going into his gaming stream and making him cry was a bit ass-holish.

And yes I think you‚Äôre biased towards john.

But he‚Äôs your friends. It‚Äôs okay to be that way man lol. Just saying that I feel like I can really notice"
@nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision Yes I think you guys are bias. Who cares. Why does that bother you. Your his friend
No u! 
@nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision Why are you so mad lol.

@nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision I can‚Äôt help you man.

Just call me if you are confused."
@Bowblax @nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision Yeah I don‚Äôt expect you to make a vid on it obviously. It‚Äôs not your content.
@nicholasdeorio @AugieRFC @Bowblax @BigMoneyOnision Yo but anyone who thinks this guy is lying about the dream dms is way off. It‚Äôs not in his character at all.
"@Bowblax @nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision So  claiming a 15 year old fan is suicide baiting, and walking up to the door of calling a 15 year old a pedo isn‚Äôt enough to make a video?

Lol alright. Different standards I guess."
@Bowblax @nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision Yeah, but that‚Äôs not what John did. John pretty much called him a pedo, and then said he suicide baited for attention and sympathy
@nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision Lol he won‚Äôt fuck you bro
"@nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision Huh?

Nah were saying this would be a massive story if it wasn‚Äôt John."

No it's not lol. They're kids going through puberty. its normal.

That would clear his name.

"If there's more of these completely reasonable explanations I think John was probably telling the truth.

It was me guys. I‚Äôm the 12 year old that framed dream

This whole thread is super virgin and I advice that you read it lol 
"@Khaliostad Saying, ‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt good at law,‚Äù isn‚Äôt criticism. He needs to explain why.

Dream did the equivalent of venting on discord

Free million hit video thanks Dream!!"
"I think John is playing victim here man. The fact that the Reddit was super small makes this credibility attack lame.

"-Dream doesn‚Äôt believe John was hacked (which he doesn‚Äôt have to).

Order of events (I think): John makes Minecraft documentary and talks to dream

-John forgets to log off computer and family friend starts sending messages from his account "
@demisaysstuff I‚Äôve never even thought about this. I guess just partner. Right?
@NJtrashboys @KEEMSTAR Oh I‚Äôm unaware of his twitch or wherever he streams
@KEEMSTAR But John never made a video on dream. Right?
@nicholasdeorio @AugieRFC dream thinking that someone else is lying is hilarious when you look at his speed running career.
@nicholasdeorio @AugieRFC Yeah if it‚Äôs already resolved dream is being big snake
@InternetUnwind @AugieRFC Yeah I see that for sure
@InternetUnwind @AugieRFC Just seems like a weird misunderstanding and now it‚Äôs just trying to prove that dreams a douchebag from posting on Reddit with 20 upvotes.
@JohnSwanYT Lol dude was right so can‚Äôt hate
@InternetUnwind @AugieRFC I see no problem with this
@InternetUnwind @AugieRFC Clip?
"@AugieRFC So all that happened was some kid leaked the ‚Äúfake dream‚Äù dms to Dream, cause John didn‚Äôt log out of a computer?

Dream then made the reddit post for whatever reason.

John then had to defend himself. Is that the whole story?"

Then what? Would you go to every high school in the country doing that same thing? Silly"
@Dippy12821579 Yes but 16 is legal where both of them are from. So what is there to be upset with? (Aside from arbitrary 3 year difference isn‚Äôt enough).
@ArchivedKnow Good take
"the big deal was that he wrote off ivory and called him a clout chaser. Ivory is a good kid and didn‚Äôt deserve to have his problems dismissed like that.

That‚Äôs why Turkey Toms vid was so important! He got answers and he got the apology to ivory!!!"
"Everyone mad at pyro for the age thing is dumb as hell. There‚Äôs literally 3 year and 2 or 3 month age difference between ivory and pyro.

"@nicholasdeorio I think if everyone handled it like you, it‚Äôd be fine.

But telling a 15 year old to take a break from the internet is dismissing the more important problem here. 

That‚Äôs all. I don‚Äôt want to dismiss the adults."
@nicholasdeorio Cause you quote tweeted me. Lmao that‚Äôs why I responded ffs
"@nicholasdeorio I‚Äôm not disagreeing with you, but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that said 20 year olds  on Twitter shouldn‚Äôt joke about a 15 year old being a pedophile.

Especially if people know he‚Äôs not socially all there. Your point isn‚Äôt wrong, but it doesn‚Äôt make mine any less true either."
@RatedUnrated @nicholasdeorio If everyone handled this situation like Nick, I don‚Äôt think we would have had a problem
@MercuryDjinn3 No. I don‚Äôt want more attention brought to it. I want people to learn and get better. But if it happens again. I will be making a video.
"I defend this community, their jokes, what they stand for.

But this sort of shit only serves as an example for why we should get banned. We‚Äôre on the chopping block ffs. 

Dear commentary community, this is why people hate us."
"aren‚Äôt capable of understanding that calling a 15 year old a pedophile (even if it is a joke) can be scarring.

This kids fucking heroes fed into this. 

I‚Äôm not saying you can‚Äôt goof on kids, just don‚Äôt call them pedophiles. Should be obvious (2/3)"
"I generally disagree with the idea that you need to be 18 to create YouTube content. 

Kids learning how to argue, joke, and edit videos is all good skills to develop. 

I do however think commentary is a bit too cut throat of a genre. Especially since adults on this site (1/3)"
@zoggyt @AllucidLol @nicholasdeorio Yeah no shit. We called him a pedo
@zoggyt @AllucidLol @nicholasdeorio From what I saw he was just an edgy 15 year old. And ultimately isn‚Äôt relevant to this situation.
"@AllucidLol @zoggyt @nicholasdeorio ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs not in the right mental state online‚Äù

Dude he was joked about (and some seriously) about being a pedo online.

Your take completely undersells what happened. Wtf"
@zack02040238 @tommycsftp @StellaVindicta I respect him owning up and apologizing. However this was a severe lack in judgement
@StellaVindicta Well deserved apology. Thank you for owning up
@tommycsftp No idea, but I think he‚Äôs a piece of shit!
@zoggyt @nicholasdeorio Bro I think the people going at this kid are the ones who need to grow
@zack02040238 @nicholasdeorio What‚Äôs his Twitter?
"@nicholasdeorio I think a better take would be to not shit on a 15 year old fan. Telling the kid to leave the internet is fucking lame.

This would mess up any 15 year old."
Ay star. Biggest retard on the internet. We can finally close that case. 
@nicholasdeorio Fuck that guy.
@nicholasdeorio @OpticDecay I still think the adults in the commentary community really did him dirty by memeing him. Kid never signed up for being called a pedo even jokingly
"@nicholasdeorio I don't think you did anything wrong here.

But whoever is talking to aiden is fucked. And people memeing his leaked dms over and over are fucked. We know it bothers him

Again he's a kid. He didn't do anything wrong. And the adults memeing him are assholes for it."
@AugieRFC fair enough then. thank you for deleting.
@jgrms_ @thekinocorner @CordWit @7539440960a 3 years age difference? Dude that happens in school all the time!
@CaptainStar16 I find more of a problem with the adults going after him than him being a 15 year old on the internet. How about his heroes stop dunking on him for twitter retweets.
@nicholasdeorio Like this kids fans of us. We can't be the one to burn him publicly. obviously that's gonna fuck him up. A god damn 15 year old is being called a pedo bro.
@nicholasdeorio Sure, but the people picking on him are adults. And you putting him on blast publicly isn't the right thing to do when you know he's freaking out.
@Femrocynical List these people. I need names.
"like wtf are you posting augie. Not the fucking time dude. 

"
awesome job commentary community. showing our best. 
"Like he's 15. He literally can't be a pedo. Fucking get it together people. 

No kid should go through this. "
"People gotta lay off pieman. Not sure if he's memeing, but he's a kid. 

Nothing he did deserves creators he looked up to shitting on him publicly. Kids potentially having a breakdown now. "
@thekinocorner @CordWit @7539440960a then why is Cordwit making it a big deal? Like god damn he's a kid and is clearly having a breakdown from these big creators he looks up to shitting on him.
@CordWit @7539440960a is a 15 year old and a 12 year old bad? I haven't been 15 in a while lmao

"@FantasyChamps15 If YouTube updated TOS clearly labeling that party blogs are not allowed during covid. And then gives people ample time to adjust. Then fair enough.

But until they do that, I can‚Äôt get behind bans."
@FantasyChamps15 It is taking away their livelihood if you ban them lmao.
@FantasyChamps15 No I think both matter and I don‚Äôt think YouTube‚Äôs qualified enough to enforce it. That‚Äôs all.
"@FantasyChamps15 I just think peoples lives and livelihood both matter. And I don‚Äôt think we need to get rid of both.

"@Herb_t45 @Croaxis_ Listen. 2020 Leafy didnt get as revenue as is. Advertisers use targeted ads anyway.  Demonitization would still exist.

@Croaxis_ @Herb_t45 Why would YouTube become more strict if 230 is removed? The point of politicians removing it is to make the website abide by free speech laws.

"@lil_steamy @GabeNwah @TAwakeChristian If YouTube did that, they would no longer have user generated content.

User generated content is a billion dollar industry. Someone else will hop on that train.

"@Croaxis_ @Herb_t45 Cause we‚Äôve seen advertisers pull out and come back several times. There‚Äôs too much money in social media. Don‚Äôt need to be on a board to see the obvious.

However, little to no youtubers make their living solely off of advertisement  in today‚Äôs world. So they‚Äôre just wrong."
@CReborn26 It will most likely just be updated. Can‚Äôt imagine a full repeal without something replacing it
@demisaysstuff This is a basless take. Literally what your saying the internet will become is what it already is.
@CReborn26 And nobody would deny that it was good for the time. But it‚Äôs been over 20 years. This desperately needs to be changed. These sites suck balls now.
@CReborn26 It really depends on what party gets a hold of it. If the dems get it, it could mean more restrictions. If the republicans get it, it will me a far less restrictions.
Fair. 
@FilmOddities This is literally fear mongering. You‚Äôre crazy if you think Netflix is the only thing that would exist. Literally not realistic at all
@BronzeShow This is exactly right.
"@FilmOddities The other forum was not considered liable since they did not moderate their site. 

After this case 230 was introduced allowing sites to moderate how they choose. Without ever being liable unless they directly put out the content"
"@FilmOddities I do lol it‚Äôs a very popular case that was used to decide the president over misinformation on two separate forums. 

One site was held liable due to moderating the forums. ‚ÄúModerating‚Äù the users had the court interpret the site as a publisher. Making them liable."
"@mrautism6 Freedom comes with consequences. 

I‚Äôd argue that letting creators like idubbbz, filthy frank, leafy, and mumkey thrive far outweighs the consequence of lion maker being allowed to upload to his dead channel."

If they allow everything, they won‚Äôt be liable for the content on their site.
"This is not how 230 works. Lot of people are confused on it. 

230 makes social media companies essentially invincible.

By removing it you force them into an ultimatum:

Either censor content and risk being liable for something you don‚Äôt catch, or allow everything. "
"@FilmOddities Companies would not be held liable unless they moderate or censors users on the site. 

Once they do that, they can be held liable. 

Companies won‚Äôt want to be liable, so they‚Äôll stop censoring users. More creative freedom for everyone."

Freedom of speech has its drawbacks for sure. But I think the freedoms outweigh the odd random shitty person."
"@ericmusicfan @TAwakeChristian Dummy no. They only become liable if they choose to moderate their content in the first place.

@Herb_t45 Advertisers do this all the time, they come back with renegotiated ad rates. Corporate America at its finest.
"@ericmusicfan Making them liable if they choose to censor content, means that they won‚Äôt censor anything. Meaning more creative freedom.

If you argue about this basic fact again I won‚Äôt respond lol. That‚Äôs what the law is."
"@ericmusicfan You don‚Äôt know what your talking about. The ‚Äúhost‚Äù would only be held liable if they choose to moderate their site.

Under 230 the host isn‚Äôt held liable ever. Moderation or not."

Lol thats already happened. Creators make most of their money off of sponsorships and merch since ads are already unreliable.

"It does mean that sites like Facebook and YouTube have less control over their own website. Some say that breaks the first amendment.

2/2"
"QnA part 2:

"@IAmAsarch @JohnSwanYT Racist YouTube channels usually have less then 1000 subs because there isn‚Äôt much of an audience for that Shit. 

Can‚Äôt be upset by stuff you don‚Äôt know about."
"@lastlineshow logan pauls video would likely be allowed, but he would probably take it down (just like he did last time) due to public backlash.

It would essentially just be YouTube from before 2016"
"@lastlineshow Hate speech is still illegal. You cannot make calls to violence.

Porn will likely be addressed when 230 is dismantled, seeing that the US has a very conservative view on nudity and porn.

There will probably be white supremacists and racists just like there are now on twitter."
@_Thudles_ @Leafy @SimianJimmy democrats want to get rid of it to make tighter restrictions on the content that goes out there. The republicans want to get rid of it to protect free speech.
@lastlineshow what is the most vile shit? again illegal content still wouldn't be allowed.
"@JohnSwanYT John there is very few instances of advertisers staying off the site. YouTube has had some of it's most profitable years  ever.

Why? Cause the site has an ever growing user base (thanks India!)

And because people advertize on it. It won't go away man, its total fear mongering."
@JohnSwanYT i understand. its just retarded.
"@JohnSwanYT @_ThePieman_ John is literally making an argument that makes no sense. I'm done arguing with stupid. He's the kind of guy that will never admit uncertainty. big lame. 

nonsense for days."
@JohnSwanYT And dude these advertizers you're talking about are back because there is nowhere else to go! if anything this makes my argument stronger!
"@JohnSwanYT The advertizers left because people snitched to them. They left because they knew they had the power to change the website.

If they don't have the power, then they won't be able to negotiate. They won't leave, because that's where the money is. common sense"
"@JohnSwanYT Bro you literally think this will end YouTube monitization. There's an entire history of these sites running just fine without enforcing their TOS.

But keep pretending you know what you're talking about, and then back tracking when you sound silly. lol "
@RealBWC @JohnSwanYT lol like I said. The US Government will likely allow them to keep porn off of their site since the US is very conservative when it comes to nudity.
"@JohnSwanYT lol john. I think demonitization would likely still be in place. So ads will not show up on edgy videos. 

And again the billions of people on social media won't be advertized to? Too much money to stay away. 

Companies will be understand John."
@slightlytal3ntd @JohnSwanYT he's literally in high school.
RT @My2t1c2 : READ THIS FUCKING THREAD 
"@JohnSwanYT Also neither of us knows if it will allow pornography on the site. lol. 

I'm fine with some titty next to my pewdiepie, but seeing the US's conservative views on porn, I'm guessing that will be addressed. lmao. 

but fear-mongering this nonsense might get you retweets."
"@JohnSwanYT John you're such know it all lol. Advertizers only left cause the WSJ snitched and got a story. 

Advertizers will come back cause they always do. Just like they existed before TOS was enforced."
"@BlameMe42049004 @JohnSwanYT @_ThePieman_ 230 effects social media platforms the most. There is no where for advertisers to go other than TV.

Billions of people use social media, advertisers will continue to advertize on sites just like they did before TOS was enforced back in 2016."
@_Thudles_ @JohnSwanYT lol you don't listen.
"@_Thudles_ @JohnSwanYT @_ThePieman_ lol they won't do that. They're a social media site. If they did that it wouldnt be social media anymore lol.

The only reason you use YouTube, Twitter, or Facebook is for the user generated content. It's the most popular form of media. Billions of users. Far greater than TV."
"@_Thudles_ @JohnSwanYT bro you clearly don't know what targeted ads are.

There are tons of ads (and targeted ads) on porn sites, but they're for sexual things. Things that you might buy if you watch porn.

There's not Pepsi ads because you probably don't want to buy Pepsi while jerking off. haha"
"@_Thudles_ @JohnSwanYT @_ThePieman_ Johns argument: The YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook will end cause there will be offensive content on it.

Mine: lol no. Everything will probably be the same with less regulations like it was 4 years ago. 

I mean one is clearly more reasonable then the other ffs."
"@_Thudles_ @JohnSwanYT have you ever wanted a cola while jerking off? Or a new fantasy football website to gamle on?

probably not. Targeted ads are what marketing teams are for. Research probably shows that porn isn't the best place to sell retail."
"@JohnSwanYT @_ThePieman_ yes advertisers will ignore the billions of people on the internet...

John. you know that companies advertized on this site before demonitization was a thing lmaooo. it ain't going anywhere bro...

the only reason ads left before is because they had the power to change things."
this idea that the internet will end cause free speech exist is the most British thing I've ever seen. lol this take is retarded. the internet will not seize to exist. 
"@JohnSwanYT 3. Advertizers will always advertize on social media. literally billions of people are on here.

4. the law will likely be reworked preventing pornography. but honestly, I don't care if there's a titty on screen.

5. Illegal content still wouldn't be allowed. You can't murde lol"
"@JohnSwanYT 1. Racist were on YouTube prior to 2017. We're all adults, we can ignore their irrelevance just like we did back then.

2. The site was around before the advertisers left in 2017. YTers made more money, and had more creative freedom."
"@JohnSwanYT lol no.

shocker. John pretending he knows the law again."
@_ThePieman_ I'm not sure. I would expect that the new rendition of the law would likely prohibit pornography from falling under this forum.
"@_Thudles_ free speech. it would literally be like it was in 2016.

There was a TOS back then. But it was never enforced until the advertisers pulled out in 2017."
"@BronzeShow I mean they still couldn't post murder. They still couldn't self harm. They still couldn't post porn. It depends on how they rework the law.

Yes. It means there will probably be some racist guy on youtube. There will probably be gun videos. 

Imo The good far outweighs the evil"
@_Thudles_ it's either all okay, or none of it is okay. I can live with that. Sites like youtube and facebook rely on users. they will not remove everyone.lmao
"However removing 230 would mean that companies are only held liable for content on their site ONLY if they choose to moderate it. Meaning that having a TOS would make them liable

Moderating it becomes a financial risk. So companies will choose to follow free speech laws instead"
"The 230 QnA:

""Companies are private, so they don't need to follow free speech.""

Yes. Under 230 companies are not held liable for user created content on their site. On top of that they choose to add things like a TOS, to enforce their rules. 1/2"
"@_Thudles_ yes under 230 companies can do that. But if you remove it, they will be held liable for content on their site ONLY if they choose to moderate it.

Moderating it becomes a financial risk. So companies will choose to follow free speech laws instead."
"In short: It's either all okay or none of it is. 

This is what the internet needs. Creators like @Leafy and @SimianJimmy wouldn't be wrongfully kicked off if this was in place.

REMOVE SECTION 230!!!

RT please. All commentators need to know about this"
230: A law that says companies are not liable for what users post to it ONLY if you moderate it. That means sites that rely on USER GENERATED CONTENT can no long use TOS to deny free speech. 
good websites suck anyway. 
I don‚Äôt know anything about 230, but it seems really unlikely that the internet will seize to exist. Lol politics suck

Same Boogie. Welcome to the commentary simp train &lt;3 
@jakedoesmemes2 @ChrisRGun @Bowblax that animation is still up on the original channel that made it. Crazy. It's like they just hated leafy and don't actually give a fuck.
"@Mistergloworm @ChrisRGun @Bowblax Dude the hypocrisies are real tho.

Idubbbz: Tells Keemstar to kill himself ""unironically."" No strike. Video is still up.

You could do this with literally anyone."
@Boogie2988 @bunnydelphine Legend!
"@jakedoesmemes2 @ChrisRGun @Bowblax bro leafy would be the only guy in youtube history to get terminated for using clickbait. 

Youtube didn't like him, so they canned him. Simple as that."
"@ChrisRGun @Bowblax like we need specifics. Everything is so arbitrary. Dude's fine for 4 months and then one day he's dead. lol.

Like don't you want job security too?"
@ChrisRGun @Bowblax yes. if leafy got a strike once a week and actually had time to adjust his content. If he gets hit all at once that's insane and unfair.
@Smas2468 @Q_Review completely different statements. I guess i'm the only one who cares about context. it's cool. just jerk eachother off in this thread
@CBTSSpecialist the 3 normal strikes expire eventually. Leafy received all 3 of these at once.
@CBTSSpecialist warnings are a 1 time lifetime strike. I have a warning too for trying to sell a pillow. It's a BS strike that youtube won't remove because "warnings don't really matter, it's just meant to warn you for the future." Outside of the warning, you have 3 normal strikes.
@bigg_gay @Theone145268383 @a13588607 old content should be treated the same way as the leafy content cop and content vigilante videos. Take them down, but don't strike them. Because old content of course can't follow newly updated TOS.
"@bigg_gay @Theone145268383 @a13588607 1. leafy never said that. Two different statements that the internet has combined cause fuck context.

2. That video was on storyfire. not youtube. so it had no role in his banning."
"The youtube strike system is supposed to give you a single strike for each piece of TOS you broke. That way you can correct your actions.

If they give you 3 strikes at once, that's not corrective at all. should be common sense. But homie is confused"
i like how everyone knows how leafy got banned besides leafy. it's classic really 
"@Deftlie_ @Boogie2988 @bunnydelphine He didn't break TOS any more or less than the other creators on this site. The rules he broke should garner him a strike. That's how it should be 

Instead they just straight up deleted him. Everyone is cool with how youtube enforces their bullshit policies until it's you next ü§î"

Now we cheer youtube on when they terminate a creator we don't like. Alex Jones being a prime example."

@CraftComputing Contribution ID 9014
@CraftComputing Man I bought this and still waiting for it to ship.
Long story short, the system needs an overhaul and I feel every creator regardless of platform size should champion the idea of strike reform to better effect everyone on the platform.
This never was an issue for me, I can get help and I‚Äôm thankful for that. I‚Äôm worried about any creator that works hard and gets the unfortunate wrath of bot moderation. We need a better system for every creator to avoid this in the future.
I find it really off putting that unless you have the ability to raise an issue on Twitter you can have your appeals be rejected within minutes and no further recourse. The system needs a change
YouTube ended up reversing the strike a few hours later, while I expected it like this and that‚Äôs fine. I really would like to get in a talk with @TeamYouTube and help come up with ways so that this doesn‚Äôt affect smaller creators who have no recourse.
".@TeamYouTube I refuse to see how this violated scam policies when I‚Äôm clearly calling out and stopping my viewers from falling prey to these obvious issues that plague your platform and many others.

I find it insane that within a minute you have manually reviewed and rejected. "

@TheActMan_YT It‚Äôs got touched up textures, UI enhancements. The 60fps is the most important and the ssd benefit from next gen systems really helps. Elevator rides still take the length of a college semester though.
@DimiTakarov Graphics are touched up but nowhere near current game standards obviously. But it runs at a solid 60fps which I find amazing considering it ran like a dementia ridden jizzrag on my Xbox 360.

@expiredsoups @Da_Bomber69 Definitely better, locations are more fleshed out and the game flows a lot better moment to moment.
@Hyo_Joestar Had more scary moments than re7 for sure, one section was entirely horror oriented. This will scare you more than re2 remake
@expiredsoups @Da_Bomber69 Oh shit I didn‚Äôt know that. The game doesn‚Äôt have a timer on the pause menu so i didn‚Äôt catch that.
@Brunobb1 Just under re2 remake. A lot longer and fleshed out.

Remember this is verified kfc account, the best brand account lmao. 
@DarkViperAU @TeamYouTube I hummed a song and it got picked up, it‚Äôs not just mental it‚Äôs a different fucking dimension.
Mine too babe 
This video might have a higher kill death ratio than any pro league player I‚Äôve seen.
YouTube shorts will literally kill you lmao 
@Yuriofwind Ahh the lost odyssey life
@Kreiser_VII Holy shit lmao that‚Äôs terrible design. Never played the game but I want to now.
Kinda miss the days when we had to switch discs in video games. Felt like the biggest story ever told.
@sumitomedia Didn‚Äôt you already do that?
@ArodMarcus Nothing here is a day zero. Stuff is unpatched but I get what ya mean that‚Äôs just good practice.
"Still not banned on discord but I‚Äôve siphoned password tokens, debunked bullshit and crashed clients.

Video tomorrow."
@ModernVintageG Unless you build your games in machine code you‚Äôre nothing but a fraud wanna be programmer.
HAHAHA STOLEN VALOR LMAO TOUCH GRASS. 
When you don't use code "SOG" 
"@sumitomedia Nah, I‚Äôm fucking around. Sometimes I do it so Adobe doesn‚Äôt crash or miss any layers for some reason. My mgs4 video I was worried about render errors.

Now when I do my big project for the month it tends to be a good safety net."
@dark1x Twitter is home to the most prime takes our species has ever heard of.
@sumitomedia I package the final edit sequence in a new project.
@SociableBarely Agreed. I think it‚Äôs shitty too we amalgamate on this one platform. At least celebs have a degree of individuality asides from all living in the same city.
Sony is being a fucking shitlord with this nonsense. It‚Äôs like they wanna forget they ever made the ps3. Thank god we have emulators for it... 
"It‚Äôs uncomfortable to see how a lot of you tubers have predator allegations, now it‚Äôs seeing all the media throw that at the entire platform.

One real negative is the guilt by association. Like it or not we all look like shit cause of a few terrible apples."
btw im so dissapointed some of you assumed this joke profile picture is gacha, bros it's fucking maplestory. no joke im sure a groomer tried messaging me on it when i was playing last night, be careful.
"As shit as some nights are it's immeadiatly made better by sitting with a hot cup of coffee and editing together a deep web video.

Thanks for giving me the opp, it's a huge reason to wake up and do something with my life that's not just a dumb grind.

Deep Web video today &lt;3"
Covering discord viruses in a couple days. If my account gets banned you know why.
@kiwi_sunset Oh yes
Fuck yeah 
I don‚Äôt think we need a remake of a game that plays pretty well and already has a remaster. Fuck it Sony can we just have SOCOM, Syphon Filter or Sly Cooper? 
I dunno how long I can do lockdown. Well over a year with no contact with anyone, no end in sight. Sorry for the bad vibes, just feels like nothing exists at the moment. I‚Äôm just really done.
Looks like I wasn‚Äôt the only one getting really high tonight :) 
@annandvirk Man that stuff is great, bought a bottle a couple years back. This makes me wanna get another.
Found this gem around my house, time really flies. Gonna turn it into a Bitcoin miner. 
RIP DMX
Who plays you in your biopic?  
@simplyloey @Loeybug 
@KavosYT Above 15 now. Ever since his apology every day people have been coming out. This shit makes all of us look bad at this point for even sharing the platform.
"How does James Charles rack up over 15 accusers. This shit is fucking disgusting bro especially when minors are so involved.

Completely unacceptable shit and the dude needs to have police intervention."
I have to appreciate how intel let‚Äôs us have just a little bit of racism if we want.
Holy shit Intel made an AI that toggles off toxicity what the fuck??? 
I know nfts are cool and all but I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd ever drop cash on a jpg.
@THEREALRTU @Razer @TeamRazer @YouTube Did you buy a gpu enclosure or is this a full system?
Can‚Äôt believe bird app tried to cancel Genshin impact lol
:/
@TheActMan_YT I wanna record left 4 dead 2 coop with you if you review it dad
Someone at Facebook needs to be fired for having 500 million user accounts leaked and then playing it off as if it's old data. Some accounts appear to be just a year old. I'm confident this has to be illegal federally and Facebook needs to own up to their shit. 
"I fuckin hate lifestyle gurus selling bullshit courses.

Fuck your rented lambo and Airbnb."
@YesIAmBackk Anarchy would be better for us at this point lmao
@Thafnine Clean as fuck dude
@Drift0r Fucking hell
@PoopyCatsLol It‚Äôs a video and I have some dmca strike stuff on this account so I‚Äôm not keeping media tweets until I can get that sorted out with twitter.
Girl on siege literally asked where the site was and some permavirgin asks her a bra size. Holy shit bro I‚Äôm glad to be a guy lmao. I‚Äôll stick my cock down your eyeball if you ask me that shit in the middle of a round.
"I wanna keep enjoying rainbow six siege. But every time I fire up a casual game I‚Äôm playing with people who snort adderol wtf.

Guys we don‚Äôt need to run out every round."
@zaptiee Lack of hygiene
"Outriders is a cool game but for the love of God can we stop making games you could play solo require an online fucking internet connection?

It‚Äôs not an MMO, it‚Äôs a fucking three player looter shooter."
@Thafnine Wut??
Hey @PlayStation if I offer you my booty will you give bloodborne a 60fps patch?
@holychwan All n gage users we‚Äôre certified virgins. I consider that a plus.
@Yuriofwind It‚Äôs a step up from 5 fps chaos theory
I‚Äôm a proper console warrior. I‚Äôll fight tooth and nail for the good old n-gage any day.
God can someone please just fucking ratio me.
@GlinkLive A fair amount depending on how you conceal your browser fingerprinting on the pc.
Today I learned the FBI is investigating limp dicked losers on counter strike for fixing matches lmao
@Regalbruh This is a Sony exclusive since the ps2 days and is a big deal for sports gamers. Now it‚Äôs popping up cross platform and on game pass day 1.
Holy shit this is kinda massive, fucking game pass is killing it lol 
I think I‚Äôm gonna get laid bros. This is getting real &lt;3 
@GFuelEnergy I want
@krisstraub At least two months
@LrdHighSummoner Same here. Grew up all over the Internet
I deleted all the vms
Patch 1.2 on ps5 wont load the world for me 
@sweetanita :)
I‚Äôll buy a tubbycoin 
@KempMou7 I‚Äôm not. I just think in terms of how we Canadians have handled it is fucked up. Our gov can‚Äôt even enforce basic lockdown rules and our vaccines are far behind. We‚Äôre like a literal fourth world rn
@UwU_face_ Sorry fuck I just read that. I‚Äôm really pissed tonight after reading that thread. Whole life has come to a stop because of this. I haven‚Äôt seen family properly in over a year.
@UwU_face_ It‚Äôs how we spell it in countries not named the ‚ÄúUnited States of America‚Äù you embryo.
"James Charles is an incredibly irresponsible creator using his platform and constantly involving himself with minors. Tons of legal cock out there and yet this manchild keeps fucking up.

Shits inexcusable."
Dude I could make a tutorial on how to install minecraft on your moms vibrator and you can‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs a scam now lmao. 
@YouTube We don‚Äôt need this feature. Dislikes help in identifying problems in content/creator. Shit I use my own dislike gauge to identify how a video is treated.
Giving cyberpunk a replay after the big patch they released. Expectations are set super low rn. 
"I don‚Äôt see the big deal with Satan shoes from lil nas x, like most things I don‚Äôt agree with on the internet I move on with my life.

Regardless tho I‚Äôm still wondering who‚Äôs blood was mixed into the shoe however."
Smell one first and tell me you‚Äôd say the same thing twice. 
@sumitomedia Videos suck ass her vagina looks like minecraft portals
@nBurd_ I‚Äôm down
@Yuriofwind Thanks brother ;-;
"You ever record an amazing fucking video and at the end when you feel good about notice the camera was never set to record.

Yeah me too..."
@Loeybug Lmao hahaha what a brainlet
@KreekCraft Good shit brother
Wholesome victory royale of the day. 
Looks like everyone‚Äôs about to miss the panty raid lmao 
@JohnWolfeYT I loved the ending section of this game a lot
@MoistCr1TiKaL Onion rings better
@XanderhalTV This cancellation shit is happening every six hours. It‚Äôs the new crack cocaine
Quick psa very important 
@ShadyTricertops I‚Äôve been longswording most of my career, think I‚Äôm about to try hammer this time.
I‚Äôd make a video but I‚Äôll save that for tomorrow cause monster hunter rise has me by the balls
@realranton Yes
"I think about all the progress we made as humans. Engineering, medicine, Arts and soon space travel one day. Yet for some reason we look and define people based on uncontrollable features.

It‚Äôll change but we gotta put in the effort. Nothing matters until we come together."
"I hope one day before I‚Äôm dead people learn to come together regardless of race and affiliation. It‚Äôs depressing to keep reading the news and timelines day after day seeing the divide.

I think about it a lot and hopefully it all gets better, in the end all we have is each other."
@annandvirk I hope it‚Äôs just pre alpha because unless this game captures old school rainbow or swat 4 it‚Äôs a bargain bin title
I should clarify I firmly bet my left testicle that @Dream didn‚Äôt say that word.
If @Dream bought the @twomad n pass he wouldn‚Äôt be getting cancelled.
@annandvirk I wanna just have a morally questioning tactical shooter with AI that keeps me on my feet as I‚Äôm clearing rooms.
@Phantom2988 Switch
"Goddamn I feel fucking old, dad picked up gems like this from some Toronto crackden and brought them home.

This was my first final fantasy game and I‚Äôm gonna try and finish it over 25 years later. "
@HealthyGamerGG Looking good dad
"I have a couple photos of me at some Indian weddings. It‚Äôs all brown people too and I don‚Äôt consider that shit embarrassing at all.

See how shit this app can be lol "
@ModernVintageG For small creators this is great... until they blow up and probably are unable to buy equity back
@Alex_ftw_456 They can barely operate their iPhone.
My parents don‚Äôt know it yet but they got their dream home. Fucking closed this place down today.
Update she was fired one hour ago by Reddit execs after claiming to not properly background check.
"Why Reddit thought it was a good idea to hire and defend someone with two people close in her family who are so open about pedo fantasies is beyond me.

Really stupid shit but unsurprising cause this is the same site that defended the jailbait subreddit."
@tha_rami @superbunnyhop We‚Äôre rogueliking war crimes I see.
@Andydemon1 Nah bro I‚Äôm level 99 I‚Äôm demolishing all the optional bosses
RT @coffeebreak_YT : TikTok's #1 Wealth Advisor 
@InfernoOmni bro im all in that game, it's pulling no punches.
@YourBudTevin with that XP gain I'll grind my eyes out.
I wish I had more time to put into JRPGs, growing up as a kid grinding to level 99 before assfucking the final boss is what I miss the most.
@YujaPlusOne I'd only expect a copy of Danganronpa Trilogy as payment and nothing else and so far I'm sitting without Danganronpa :(
@SpawnWaveMedia Big brain plays
Gamestop keeps trending and winning, I remember I once hated this company for fisting me in trade in deals and now I think I'm gonna go buy a game from them just for the hell of it lmao.
@PhillyD Deus ex
@Slasher Skype still goes strong for people out of the discord loop. I think it‚Äôll go well considering discord is gonna be self sufficient at this point post acquisition
The story of #Sex2 is amazing but I feel the gameplay was personally inferior to the original when you added more than two players to the party.
Should I fly my ass to Texas? 
"Before anyone cancels me on the tone indicators I‚Äôm just giggling about them looking like legit 4chan threads.

It pisses a lot of losers off if you use them for no reason so keep doing it. It‚Äôs two letters and if it helps someone out telling a joke go for it."
All my tones are /r from now on
Someone said I should use tone indicators on this site and all I have to say is why do they all look like 4chan threads lmao. 
@ScottTheWoz I have a reason to keep on living thank you dad
@ModernVintageG Megaman Battle Network and Metroid Fusion
@SlushTV_ These dudes aren‚Äôt clown @SlushTV_ , they‚Äôre crackden Cirque de Soleil.
@FredInTheKnud @MoistCr1TiKaL Vouch
Further clarification cause of the character limit. I don't condone this unprofessionalism but I would say this is on the same level of what rock stars do with groupies. I don't agree with it but this isn't predatory behaviour like Twitter is hiveminding over.
"The more I look into these Game Grump allegations the more I'm leaning on that this is unprofessional behaviour.

Messaging someone at 18, then meeting them at 22 when 30 and having sex isn't pedophilia. I hate people who throw that term around so willingly."
Fuck bro these new game grumps allegations are hitting pretty hard :(
Onlyfans would go bankrupt. 
I‚Äôm actually so triggered by this comment I‚Äôm gonna review Deus ex and fucking make you look install it.
@punjablpower Tons of options to attack each objective, real proper role playing and a kickass story and world to explore.
I quit youtube 
Last few posts people got questions if I‚Äôm gay or something. Bro nothing wrong with playing on the same team here and there I guess. Figure I should just say something. &lt;3
@SociableBarely Yes
@daftpunkplease @SlushTV_ I genuinely am not a quarter of as good as these people. They‚Äôre fucking gems.
@annandvirk Yeah we‚Äôre all cringe
I just want final fantasy 7 part 2
I found the second coming of Jesus on Reddit. Video tomorrow babe
Full context dude is just joking on stream peep the smirks toward the end.
I swear this dudes sarcasm is off the fucking charts. 
Btw it‚Äôs fucking brain dead to steal iPhones. The things are server locked to iCloud so you‚Äôre literally sitting with an unusable product that pings your location once you connect it back to the Internet.
I had an alright day I guess. 
Cyberpunk 2077s response to fixing the police system was literally spawning them a bit further away lmao 
Uploading a video about spanking valorants anti cheat. It‚Äôs kind of like virus investigations lmao
Fucking sleep paralysis is coming back daily again :(
Dudes battery is on 1% for the last 50 years. 
@BasedStudMuffin I‚Äôm kinda surprised casual matchmaking has this much sbmm and it‚Äôs making me not want to pick up this years cod. They have ranked but barely push it which I think is the big problem.
@BasedStudMuffin It‚Äôs taken so much fun out of the game now that I have to sweat each game
@FortniteR870 Agreed. Still I wish it didn‚Äôt happen at the rapid pace it has I‚Äôm starting to get surprised at how many people their are doing this shit
"I think everyone on the David dobrik situation is just kind of a piece of shit tbh.

Fucking hate these stories on YouTube of people even allegedly doing heinous shit. It‚Äôs so fucked."
@TheActMan_YT It‚Äôs still wild. I can‚Äôt find a store in my area that‚Äôll even do walk in purchases. It‚Äôs all online which sucks.
Three years is nothing for the kind of risk he opened people up to tbh, fucking loser lmao 
"I was on Grindr and it told me about all the anti Asian hate going on.

From the bottom of my heart please stop falling into the pits of hating people for shit they had no control over."
@rickyberwick Hope you get better brother &lt;3
I fucking hope aliens kill us all sometimes. 
This new rainbow six siege season slaps uwu
@TeamYouTube Appreciate the response. I‚Äôll watch the language going forward in that regard.
Can update sizes chill the fuck out. Feels like I‚Äôm sitting installing patches more than playing games lmao.
@oompaville Bro come on now I‚Äôm at least c tier
@InternetUnwind Honestly I was surprised reading the comments, she‚Äôs just goofing lol
@TheRalphRetort Good luck to your mother, hope she recovers well.
@JakeSucky I like her dry humour
@SlushTV_ Being verified is a sin
"RT @EEvisu : Another #DoYouKnow is live, really glad these are catching on more &amp; more, channeling my ignorance has been fun.

S/O to @OrdinaryGamers &amp; @CharlesThoren_ for taking the challenge, it was a pleasure (for me at least lmaooo)

FULL VID:  "
I wake up and read the most brain dead shit sometimes lmao. 
Once again @TeamYouTube how does this video contain any sexual or nudity for which it was turned 18+ for? 
@twomad Same
@CFCGiroud Maybe, I‚Äôm worried it just forces riot to plug the loophole up even though it should have been noticed from the beginning.
"A fun project, valorant can be run under virtual machines containing the kernel anticheat.

It also took only 4 lines to put in to get it working too. "
@DarkViperAU Time zones, I literally just woke up Jesus Christ.
@KEEMSTAR @NexpoYT He‚Äôs fucking great.
RT @Yuriofwind : After Hours :3  
@DadFeels Dad join the party
@NexpoYT babe I pinged your imposter in this.
"I fucking would kill to go and have a beer with some good friends like @nexpo @mamamaxYT and @NightDocsYT.

The greatest thing about the yt experience are the relations and friends built along the way. That includes you babes reading this. Love u"
"@neekolul Jesus this is a moment where you really get tested, I‚Äôm glad you ended up being strong enough to discuss this.

We‚Äôre always here for ya &lt;3"
@punjablpower I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs live service but playable off the disc offline. I hate online only live service shit.
@punjablpower I‚Äôm hyped, the latest screenshots looked great. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be a banger I just wanna continue the story.
@IndoorSitup Been rocking halo 2 anniversary and 3.
I‚Äôve spent the last 48 hours addicted to halo multiplayer and I just wanted to let you know the first step was admitting I have a problem.
@pokimanelol @sonic_hedgehog
"RT @sumitomedia : yooo thanks for the shoutout @OrdinaryGamers 

also thanks for the same joke everyone else üòá "
God has left the server and deleted the account. 
This person took Wal-Mart repackaging too personally lol 
@YourBudTevin Shit I‚Äôll give it a download why not
I think I fell down a Chinese state run propaganda YouTube rabbit hole. Lemme kill my brain cells first and I‚Äôll make a video babe.
@kiwi_sunset It‚Äôs a big problem. Once I reached 25 it magically went away.
Bro we‚Äôre at PowerPoint frame rates here lmao 
Let‚Äôs be real Pepe le pew was hella fucking weird.
@SubToOptimus I forgive you man
@HuggbeesTV Let‚Äôs start a jihad against Covid bro
@exe_waffle Those are hackable systems. PS5 doesn‚Äôt have any hacks running on it atm. Even if they did the firmware would update and you would be required to give up hacks to play online.
@TsukiiiVAL Nothing can stop dossing unless you VPN and hide your IP. As long as you have your IP publically anyone can dos you.
Why does a console need anti cheat tech when you can‚Äôt run modified code on it to begin with? Seems pointless as their aren‚Äôt true hackers on a console asides from people using keyboards and mice on unsupported games. 
@InfernoOmni When are the hedges putting a hit out lmao
GameStop stock is surging again wtf is happening.
@girlfromcanada Don‚Äôt gaming publications pay you for articles written?
Dude this is so terrible for mature channels. Twitch literally made their version of the Chinese social credit system. 
It grows taller everytime you use code ‚ÄúSOG‚Äù at GFuel. 
@L1nko64 I don‚Äôt enjoy any company buying out like this. what we‚Äôre seeing is the true monopolistic origins of Microsoft play out. It‚Äôs a shame too because in the video game industry their technically not a monopoly but they‚Äôre the only ones with the cash reserves to pull these deals off.
"Sony needs PlayStation to be successful year after year which I hope they are. Microsoft doesn‚Äôt care if Xbox flips a profit at all since they care about having high numbers to show in game pass subscriptions.

They don‚Äôt even care if you use an Xbox to game."
"People who fight console wars keep comparing Microsoft to Sony as equals.

MS doesn‚Äôt care about 7 billion to buy a company for a few IPs, they print money by being one of the biggest tech firms in the world.

What matters is Xbox doesn‚Äôt waste ownership of what they bought."
@BurgerKingUK what‚Äôs the number to the based dept?
Someone‚Äôs losing their job lmao what a dumbass 
@MoistCr1TiKaL I‚Äôm an Olympic gold medalist at it.
"4chan Hijacking rabbit hole for those who want to be blown away by how insane the Internet can get.

"
40 minute long video on how 4chan was hijacked by a cult uploading now!
Who‚Äôs this David dobrik fellow and why can I not stop seeing him in my TL
@RealYungCripp Warriors remaster on the new engine would be a banger
Man fuck gta6 I just want manhunt 3
@neekolul Checking it out :)
@gardiner_bryant This error is odd. If it‚Äôs VFIO the card should just blank but it seems like it‚Äôs reattaching to the host OS which shouldn‚Äôt happen. You should still get that reset bug on mainline kernel but no reason to crash the kernel. Are you running your vm in user space or in system?
@gardiner_bryant Is it single gpu pass through?
@gardiner_bryant This is why I stopped Firefox and switched to brave. Somethings off on Google based sites
Gonna be real I‚Äôd rather watch a relaxing livestream than a creator who snorted lines and now won‚Äôt shut the fuck up about that double kill they got on warzone. 
YouTube‚Äôs pretty based lately. 
I know the first one is deviantart soft core, I don‚Äôt really care about the redesign I wasn‚Äôt jacking off to a cartoon rabbit to begin with.
Damn dog this new generation can‚Äôt be furpilled anymore. 
Walmart and Best Buy have literally no online store protections. My friend tried to buy a ps5 the moment they got restocked but instead he took a good old fashioned dicking
Played cyberpunk for so many hours and just realizing they spelled delivery wrong all over the city and never patched it lmao. 
You team kill me on rainbow six I‚Äôm gonna make fun of you no matter your age. 
God I fucking hate windows 10 so much.
It‚Äôs always the verified ones who tweet the dumbest shit. 
@GibiOfficial Not a bad idea.
Goddamn this game gets more beautiful. 
"30 hours in with no sleep but I have perfected the poor mans virtual machine rig.

Now I gotta figure out how to do a video for it. All I know is it‚Äôs gonna be long and very nerdy."
"Why would you use a term that excludes the people you try to include?

Just call someone who wants to be identified as a woman a woman. It ain‚Äôt hurting anyone.

Fucking dipshits "
Use code ‚ÄúSOG‚Äù on gfuel and I‚Äôll show you a good time baby ;)
Cause I lost a bet 
goddamn why is minecraft so fucking addicting
Dude hello games is killing it! 
@twomad alhamdulillah brother
Damn son at least let the game come out lmao. 
Why is it that every fucking week ‚Äúnazi‚Äù ends up trending?
@meatcanyon Welcome to the club, I got banned for impersonating myself.
James Charles is a dipshit for sexting fans. Dude should know how risky this stuff is especially with really young fans, no real excuses.
@cytoscourge @necrodeer Cause I‚Äôm always watching son
Bro that Pok√©mon legends game looks pretty sweet!
Xbox live shitting bricks rn?
Is YouTube a bit busted today?
I‚Äôm actually excited for the new fnaf game for some reason
Super follows sounds really stupid. I ain‚Äôt paying 4.99 a month to read shitposts. 
@GibiOfficial Yeah I‚Äôd eat it more often if it wasn‚Äôt for the mercury bs
"I fucking hate windows 10 and it‚Äôs fucking brain dead update system. My entire stream system defaulted last night and I‚Äôm sitting changing a bunch of settings again.

I hope one day we can be rid of the plague that is this operating system. Fuck windows 10 and it‚Äôs mother."
@ModernVintageG I swear I wonder if the reason is so big is to use uncompressed assets to give the old cpus breathing room. But that doesn‚Äôt explain the next gen Cold War releases being so big then, it‚Äôs really dumb.
"Man this is just depressing at this point, hopefully this game gets updated to a playable degree with restored features.

Till then yakuza like a dragon exists and I highly recommend you pick that up and have a good old time. "
@twomad This one bro 
@SkillUpYT You‚Äôre telling me you haven‚Äôt shit yourself at the idea of port royale 3?
"Any politician who wants to ban violent video games hasn‚Äôt realized that talking to kids about the stuff they watch and being a parent is the effective solution.

Don‚Äôt fucking make kids if you can‚Äôt parent them you fucking troglodytes."
I can live with that. Thanks 
It‚Äôs fucking Tuesday and persona 5 strikers is out in gonna coom
Omg I can‚Äôt wait for the scalpers to fucking hijack this treasure. 
Took less than five minutes to reject an appeal 
I literally have no idea how this pewdiepie video is age restricted @TeamYouTube I have shown nothing worth making this 18+ 
I swear my whole life is a shitpost lol
Still haven‚Äôt seen a next gen console in stores holy shit this is insane.
@InfernoOmni Cause you‚Äôre a good person
Removed last post cause the service I showed was utter dogshit and you bet your ass I‚Äôm not promoting discount deviantart
"DRM is the biggest joke in gaming. Easy to bypass and all this shit serves is ruin games going forward. Sometimes it‚Äôs easier to run pirated games than buying that shit on Steam.

Fuck DRM."
@punjablpower It‚Äôs gods gift to the world, easiest shit I‚Äôve ever bypassed when it comes to anti cheat
Rainbow six quick match is the sweatiest shit I‚Äôve ever seen. Motherfucker it‚Äôs casual.
Back in action, daily uploads start today :)
Damn dude pewdiepies video got removed for harassing cocomelon? We‚Äôre getting softer than marshmallows.
"Yo Nintendo stop being bitches and give us twilight princess/windwaker HD on the switch.

Make that fat collection and sell for a day idc."
@sumitomedia Get well soon brother
We have a new law called Bill c21 shits super vague and somehow it seems airsofting is at risk :(
"BRO THEY‚ÄôRE TAKING MY GUNS AWAY AGAIN IN CANADA.

AIRSOFTS TOO LMAO."
"Instagram removed my account for ‚Äúimpersonation‚Äù, now they want a photo ID?

Zuckerburg you can eat my hairy ass the day I give you fucking government id over your shitty social networks lol"
"My entire timeline is swamped with @Dream rn.

Dog what fucking nonsense is going on today."
Finally at home 
Allowed to go home today :) need to rest the next week to get in the clear.
How the fuck can they call this the history channel it‚Äôs just dudes sucking each other‚Äôs cocks over alien footage from 1978.
Fuck man now this hospital has a Covid outbreak just let it end man
@OMGLove Thanks cousin
No going home today. Needed to be fever free for 24 hours. Worst comes to worst may need another ct scan
@LrdHighSummoner If I‚Äôm out I will you my rtx 3090
I hope I get to go home today.
I managed my first walk to the bathroom after surgery. Gonna tackle the wing after breakfast :)
I just found out some moron put gorilla glue in their hair, how can you be this fucking dumb lmao
Update. Surgery was a success. We had a risk of my body ‚Äúcocooning‚Äù but the surgeon removed the appendix and all the gunk. Laying in recovery. They‚Äôll start training me on fluids tomorrow.
Emergency room getting my tests 
@KEEMSTAR Btw lawyer tells me to remind you I‚Äôm not a finance expert
@KEEMSTAR This mans just mad he missed $doge
‚ÄúPls... you deserve it... just pls‚Äù 
Covid test came back negative this is a viral that‚Äôll go away whenever it wants to fuck off. Like relatives you hate to see.
Little update. Fever fluctuates from 98 in the morning to 103.9 right now. I think I‚Äôll break it cause I have too. Don‚Äôt worry we‚Äôre still miles away from my brain cells cooking and leaving me a tiktok dance channel.
Health update hit a high score of 101.9 celsius on the body temperature. Hopefully it‚Äôs not Covid. Head fucking hurts tho.
Even YouTube fucks with the inflation porn. 
Remember the time a cult infiltrated 4chan and caused some members to have severe mental problems and end up hospitalized? Video tomorrow.
I‚Äôve never been this sick. If I‚Äôm dead in the morning we had a kickass run and I‚Äôll tweet about how boring the afterlife is without you bitches &lt;3
My imposter will one day beat me lol 
"This pandemic has almost no end here where I live. It‚Äôs fucked to think my entire province is locked in a state of emergency indefinitely. I have no idea when things will go to normal or if thats gone out the fucking wind. Fuck this shit.

The world just fuckin stopped."
Fuck me I‚Äôm getting old I need to retire I‚Äôm falling for basic trolls.
Bro search up ‚Äúoar grease‚Äù on YouTube lmao
YouTube ads 2021 
"Logan Paul‚Äôs a dipshit for saying either keem or h3h3 should get harassed.

No one deserves that shit on the Internet with complete degenerates finding each and every way to fuck with you."

Fuck it I‚Äôm on the dogecoin train let‚Äôs go baby
Keep poor people poor amirite 
I feel kinda bad for selling GameStop stock, honestly seeing the blood spilled by hedge funds is worth losing millions
Goddamn it im feeling sick
"Fucking @RobinhoodApp just fucked over the average person buying stock on the market and still let the billionaires have their fun. The game is fucking rigged from the start.

Hope you secured the gains."

I can‚Äôt wait For the stock market to open this morning.
Ya love to see it 
Hey hey thanks YouTube babe &lt;3 
The only difference is the stock manipulation isn‚Äôt happening with the billionaire hedge funds behind the shadows. Now they‚Äôre fighting Redditors with too much time to spare. 
@Jack_Septic_Eye Take your time. Sorry for your loss man.
Wall Street billionaires losing their shit on Twitter after today‚Äôs GameStop surge has me fucking dying. Losing well over $8 billion in a day has to hurt.
I‚Äôm gonna become the first Indian vtuber  now

GameStop stock paid the mortgage lol
My favourite bug of the year. 
"I‚Äôm really getting tired of this shit, close to speak out on this. Only reason I‚Äôve been quiet is because so many people tell me not to engage for this persons health and I should be a bigger person.

Fuck me I‚Äôve slipped down a new rabbit hole. BRB going full sigma. 
I think it‚Äôs unfair for one creator to get striked while others walk away with no issue. If this is truly an issue I would prefer @TeamYouTube to pass the strikes to everyone or make sure diesel patches gets overturned his video was advocating against harming minors.

@jschlatt Hey guy
Man these are tragic trends, strangling yourself with a belt I don‚Äôt even know how that becomes a ‚Äútrend‚Äù but heart goes out to the family. Idk how one can blame tiktok when the dicks who started this trend should be the ones called out specifically. 
I loved playing resident evil tonight on stream &lt;3
"Services like Xbox live and PlayStation network shouldn‚Äôt require a sub fee, asides from the big titles (of which most are already f2p) still require peer to peer and you hosting from your network.

@NexpoYT Its fuckin amazing!!
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 
Well fuck me can‚Äôt argue with this 
Add a new policy you fucking dumbasses.

For those who wanna watch this masterpiece 
Me and my friends watched a found footage movie last night and I still can‚Äôt get over this shot they used. 
"I appreciate the response to the genuine concerns of the game and the roadmap to make it better but I refuse to believe the QA team didn‚Äôt find the same bugs we all did.

Not everything‚Äôs a fucking personal attack on your sheltered life "
Hate to say this is what happens when the whole site becomes over saturated, you have to compete like a motherfucker and even then only the few at the top thrive.

At least Trump still has a MySpace.

@nicholasdeorio You have a gun trained on you and still proceed to be stupid than idk how anyone can say you weren‚Äôt playing a stupid game to begin with. Shits just sad to watch.
I really hope since @Twitter is on their little ban spree, can they put just five minutes of effort and shut down this disgusting hashtag used to sell child exploitation for over a year? 
@CFCGiroud If they play it smart a few grand every month I‚Äôd say.
This dude took a 10 second laugh clip and got 600k TikTok followers. Follow your dreams kids anyone can do it. 
It‚Äôs turning out day after day that the massive solar winds hack turned out to actually be Russian intelligence agents and it goes beyond just Solwarwinds. Shits insane.
I‚Äôm not verified @twitch. I‚Äôm only a shitposter not a political commentator yet.

@HuggbeesTV We‚Äôre in new game plus right now dude
@ScottKrs I always hope for the best cause every new day is a new beginning and a chance for us to wake up in a Minecraft reality.
When we wake up tomorrow we can officially say we lived through an apocalyptic event.
Solid priorities there, you saved the world with this one I was shitting my britches up until this point.

@CommentCopped What an actual troglodyte.
To add beyond the character limit, you really shouldn‚Äôt get involved with fans like this due to the power dynamic and if photos are sent in this age range it‚Äôs something that should never have happened.
@KavosYT we‚Äôd get sued by the second episode but it would be great.
"This is fucked up. How long is it till the Internet realizes to wait for a response and from what I‚Äôve seen a two year age gap between two people shouldn‚Äôt brand someone as a ‚Äúpedo‚Äù. Tons of high school relationships would have ended in handcuffs.

Wait for both sides Twitter. "
On YouTube you should just stick to yourself completely and avoid any risk of cancellation I swear.

"@realDan203 @DDXofficial @Get_Flanked VMs/containment are completely legitimate methods to game, this isn‚Äôt just for devs anymore since modern hardware has simplified this considerably.

VMs should be allowed, anti cheat is just an arms race that encroaches on user privacy,better anti cheat exists without banning vm"
@realDan203 @DDXofficial @Get_Flanked No if they really gave a shit they‚Äôd check for proper VM exits but instead they wanna ban as many as they can and actually fluff up the numbers to sell more of their anti cheat.
@realDan203 @DDXofficial @Get_Flanked It took five minutes to bypass their VM checks, they‚Äôre not doing anything to stop real hackers.
@Get_Flanked Dude these peoples anti cheat is so fucked they blanket banned VMs and It takes five minutes to bypass their checks. If you wanted to inject hacks it‚Äôs easier than breathing.
How has Twitter still not locked down the ‚ÄúScott The Woz‚Äù Twitter account after it‚Äôs been so blatantly hacked?

I love seeing people get bigger on YouTube. This year I‚Äôve seen tons of creators hit big milestones this shit year. I hope 2021 has big things for all of us.
sorry need to update on "exact", investigating numerous mods that provide ip info, some are providing postal codes and some aren't, really a mixed bag atm.
@BadBroBuster @RockstarGames as far as I know the game is still p2p on each console so IPs are still logged, game has no form of dedicated servers at all.
"working on a follow up to the GTA Online video today, the game is a literal free for all when it comes to security, use a VPN when you sign onto Los Santos, modders know your exact location and can keep records of it.

BTW @RockstarGames has let this happen for years."

All of the beautiful places to see in Mexico and some loser is gonna pick VidCon lol
@largersizeman i really like Ghosts of Tsushima, i just feel the first part of the ff7 remake really captured Midgar, the visuals, music and redefined gameplay is a great step forward for the whole final fantasy franchise and I love seeing it as i'm a huge ff fan.
@iNabber69 when we're cashing our retirement checks.
man ff7 remake was the best game of 2020 imo

@nicholasdeorio I‚Äôd love it but Nintendo would find a way to auto level your starter to 100 before the first gym.
I will never play a match of siege with voice chat again holy fuck.

btw I saw the "family guy" video I made hit 100k likes and I told you I'd make an onlyfans and I'm a man of my word so I'll make it when I get some free time next week.

@HopelessFusion I got some work tonight, need to pull an all brighter unfortunately.
You guys deserve a lot more than $600
@annandvirk in a way yeah they were wanting to see the return on the investment, unfortunetly CD projekt red told them the console versions ran great, so lack of communication and honesty had investors push, i would suppose had they seen the state of the game they'd hold back.
@annandvirk They lied to shareholders unfortunately
if this twitter account gets banned cause i get one more dmca strike i honest to god don't care, it's been a good run lol
@OMGLove You as well

@kaan_ozzy On ps4/ps5 system storage should give an exact amount, I believe Xbox unfortunately totals the overall save size of all saves combined so you may not get the exact reading there.

Hopefully the game gets reworked, retooled and shipped out the way it should have been shipped."

@TheActMan_YT Thanks man :) I loved your Cold War vid.
"@TheActMan_YT Game devs are some seriously underpaid passion project fellas. I think the lack of unionization and proper pay is somewhat reflective of a culture that doesn‚Äôt value time management very well like other software fields.

Most dev studios need a restructure going forward."
@Jake766671 So to recuperate dev costs they would release and unfinished build and sell it deceptively to a group of people, even with your scenario they should have cancelled past gen versions and released on the next gen like dying light did.
I swear to God people defend a gaming company more than its own fucking shareholders in 2020 lmao
@Jake766671 If it‚Äôs designed for ps5 and series x why are the discs printed for the last generation system and the game originally launching in April before next gen was a thing?
"I enjoy the game but you deserve the shit for deliberately hiding the footage of the base versions.

Hopefully next time this can be avoided but I refuse to believe you had minimal understanding of how bad this game ran when you printed it to discs. At least refunds are offered. "
Holy shit pornhub literally deleted unverified content that contained illegal shit not because they should have but because fucking visa and MasterCard decided to gangbang them lol

Fuck yes I was waiting a decade for this to drop. 
Thin Tillis and the recording companies can eat a mossy asshole for even thinking about jail time for violating dmca while you stream holy shit we gamers need a PAC 
@PaymoneyWubby @YouTube Just start doing naked yoga bro make some educational content &lt;3

"@realranton I always theorized if we can use ray tracing data as a way to create realistic field of view cones for npcs and use that to calculate cops in the vicinity of areas to investigate with this new tech.

Cops realistically hear gunshots near them and investigate."
@realranton Bro every npc just spawns around you. I think honestly rockstar does wanted systems the best in games.
@FluxWild1y What‚Äôs the size of his hog tho?
@RealYungCripp It‚Äôs more disabled than you bro
when it works it works man, the wait is over and I'm just glad to be ripping a bike through the highway I waited almost a decade to witness. 
@HuggbeesTV Can you share a screenshot of the fireworks that pop out on the YouTube studio that makes me smile :)
Don‚Äôt worry doom eternal you won an award in my books my little pogchamp &lt;3
@Alex_ftw_456 Did nothing but give me maybe 5 more fps on avg regardless of the setting
"Can someone tell me how to hit a playable FPS on cyberpunk I‚Äôm avg like 45 FPS on an rtx 3090 and i9-9900k and I‚Äôm under 4K

No matter what setting I‚Äôm getting the same frames. Going to low gives me 58fps avg. what the fuck"
This dude has a 5.7 million follower account and even his mom won‚Äôt like his tweets. 
@Jeanmat_ Yeah, I‚Äôll take surviving then fighting in the courts. It‚Äôs not ideal but it‚Äôs more doable than most people think, just really fucking expensive.

Man the base version of cyberpunk 2077 on base ps4/Xbox one feels like you‚Äôre Mr. Magoo losing a bar fight.
@JoshJayDaC  :)
@TheTwoon You are cute bud
Good afternoon you cute fuckers &lt;3
Night everyone that was a fucking great cyberpunk stream we had half a million playbacks on it and the prologue fully complete.
@Boogie2988 Didn‚Äôt you get it for PC shit unlocks in less than an hour.
Fixed my graphic card! Fuckers slapped an over clock on it right on the card I had to flick the switch the size of a mouse dildo to make it work but I did it
Lol can‚Äôt stream I think gpu is dead :(
@tamtom_1 I have a streaming review copy on PC
The turrets i mentioned that were indestructible on top of the ‚Äútower‚Äù segment are completely missing from the original build, they are introduced in patch 1.02 as a way to gate story progression I believe. If you delete the game and reinstall on Xbox/ps you can play normally.
"I‚Äôm gonna have to give the massive fucking 180 IQ move.

The original 1.0 code on the disc is buggy but totally playable after I deleted the game on ps5 and reinstalled.

CD Projekt Red seems to have patched the game before release to prevent story progress and spoilers LOL"
@SkillUpYT I hope 120fps modes become a standard on shooters. Some type of feature at least it‚Äôs amazing on cod
@Field_Agent_R @Lil_Jallee No the disc is the copy of the game that went gold and was sent to be certified by Sony/microsoft as playable from start to end credits. Not a license key specifically
@Lil_Jallee The day one patch is irrelevant. CDPR have shipped an unplayable game on disk which goes completely against console certifications. You cannot complete the game that was shipped on the disk
@xQc @CyberpunkGame Just fucking take my copy I‚Äôm done
@KiwiArkangel Ill be streaming it launch on PC with full maximum settings
@El_Cilantro Not in the goddamn tutorial that‚Äôs for sure, I skipped it cause that soft locked me
@SPARTANGAMER021 It does have a wanted system yes.
@OddSpecimenn Yeah, I expected nothing more than refined open world Deus ex and that‚Äôs what you get.
"As pissed as these bugs can make me, several hours into cyberpunk and the best review I can say is it feels like a much more expansive and open world Deus Ex: Human Revolution.

If you loved the Deus Ex games you‚Äôll love this. Don‚Äôt expect GTA."
I just want to clarify, CD Projekt RED didn‚Äôt ask me to take down the video, dmca law isn‚Äôt allowing me to show you material before embargo dates.
@rickyberwick I‚Äôd rather be banned, man this shit pisses me off a lot. Fuck this fucking game
Sorry guys and gals apparently I can‚Äôt show footage of game breaking bugs. Pray to god the tutorial is fixed on launch day. I‚Äôm gonna uninstall this and play sackboy
I‚Äôm gonna just say this is a dog shit excuse. I‚Äôm looking at a game breaking bug in the tutorial. The version you print should be play-tested for at least the first 30 minutes I would hope. 
"Btw guys our merch went live today and I had it featured on our newest video, please check it out :)

"
@DrInanisVitae I did as well
The wait comes to an end 
@InfernoOmni They straight needed to add cutscenes on launch day I remember
"Cyberpunk pre patch is rough as hell. I honestly wish when these games go gold they are truly playable from start to finish without super game breaking bugs.

I know a day one patch is needed but this practice needs to called out and games can‚Äôt be printed this rough by any dev."
Stans are really gross
Bro someone‚Äôs out making Minecraft sex tapes with me laughing on tiktok lol wtf 
Further context regarding recent allegations floating in the community. You should always maintain your distance and if you know a fan or someone is underage you need to back off. Seek help if you‚Äôre attracted instead of making the gravest mistake and harming a kid in the process
It‚Äôs just so easy to not groom kids over the internet, why do so many creators fuck this up I swear.

the guy at the bottom of my board got 16 kills but only confirmed five costing us the win. they only cared about kills."
yeah im not bothering with this cold war shit anymore. refunding this and picking it up used for the campaign/zombies. 
@loafyxo out right now sorry :(
metal gear solid 2 was way fucking ahead of its time lol  
@M3M3_GuY its all for a video this month. 1 big video each month on a topic that fancies me is something im into. last month was mgs4.
im trying to write a program in TempleOS what am i doing with my life.
"gonna be real, family is the most important thing to me, if i look tired its because my grind is dedicated to them. im really thankful for having my parents and brother in my life, my best friends and all.

day off today my aunt invited me over for dinner :)
man we're splitting hairs this next gen, seriously tho i doubt most gamers will see the ui for more than a few seconds to even care once the game loads. 
"call of duty cold war pc beta is great everyone. the feeling of being in the centre of a 10 man gangbang with loads dripping of your face is captured perfectly well.

its a beta lads chill out on the sweat, this aint a gatorade commercial."
im allergic to higher framerates and resolutions. i agree bud. 
Give Unity all the shit in the world but its a solid ac game and still looks gorgeous.

i just found out people took Blaire White seriously. i always thought she was a dumbass tbh.
hey hey sexy twitter isnt broken anymore &lt;3
@twomad im down if you let me spread my conspiracy theories.
@ModernVintageG its an odd engine. ive seen it mature with my own eyes since the days of Yakuza 6 but you could tell it was GPU bound on any system you threw it at with its fluctuating resolution counts on current gen systems. that and the framerate is always hovering around 25-29 territory.
im fucking dead lol 
"even if sony isnt directly recording and people are sending them clips which is the case please dont say its illegal.

i dont like it but its a private platform and you sign up to this on almost any social network you go on.

"So im getting confirmations this VC PS4 recording nonsense is real.

i dont trust Sony to hold voice data securely when they were caught back in 2011 storing passwords in plaintext.

love playstation (and this isnt only a ps prob) but this weird dystopian trend needs to die down."
can someone confirm if this is real? im not getting this message but if it is that's kinda gross. 
"the amount of people im reading in the comments who thought I leaked my actual IP address hurts.

Calm down its a local IP address, the only one hacking it is my sleep paralysis demon."
@AngryJoeShow I tend to ignore the politics and watch the YouTube video. I think more people should just understand that you as a resident of the US have been given the right to speak about the future of your country. I hope the best case for the United States and for you.

this is a rogue moderation bot, i like to call out shit but I have to give Google credit here."
@BoiSurielle its just never going to be that easy, most of the ML bots used can go so far. the best case scenario is to isolate content like this and push for expedited peer review, covid is fucking that however.
"adding one final thing, anyone using this trend #AnswerUsPedoTube should understand that YouTube is NOT defending predators willingly. that's ignorant.

this is youtubes moderation bots going above and beyond. all i ask is human teams understand and hopefully rectify this issue."
while I understand with COVID most of the YouTube team is bots atm. for creators we're led to believe through the creator dashboard that these are manually reviewed by a human. idk about Max and his specific case for review but bots shouldn't be used to review v. sensitive videos

"I'm about to lose it right now, you're telling me everytime they teleported in Star Trek, they fucking died??

If the atoms get torn in half and reconstructed in another location the original dies and the new one is then considered a clone. So then everyone was already dead?"
@h3h3productions close enough lol
@h3h3productions did you do it at 3AM?

"halo infinites visuals are definitely on the poor side.

understand this is a game coming out on new hardware and also og xbox one. 60fps took away fidelty on each console.

"I have to be appreciative to you all, some of you came out offering financial support cause of the last tweet.

This topic is something we want to cover and feel no need to make $ on, turned down sponsors and it's cool, other avenues of revenue. Traffickhub needs coverage is all."
im self demoninitizing this pornhub video. i dont have a clue if that kills it in the algorithm or whatever, i hope you enjoy it and hopefully share it. this rabbit hole is wild.
@twomad @rileyreid she more than good. she fine.

Writing a blank cheque is just gambling."
@coffeebreak_YT I don't see the problem this is perfect.
After this halo video is out, we're deep diving into this pornhub nonsense. This is fucked.
China shouldn't complain or bitch their apps are getting a ban. They have been constantly stifling external tech companies from ever profiting in their territory.
@Boogie2988 and as far as bans are considered, China is one country i dont sympathize with as they do not favourably act towards outside tech firms entering their land.
"@Boogie2988 its actually being assessed as a national security risk in regards to how it handles user data for US users.

Its reverse eng/privacy concerns stem from recent information regarding its abuse of permissions on mobile platforms and the potential for Beijing to overtly backdoor."

"RT @gamerfrommars : I find it funny that creators can't go after another Youtuber's appearance by the current guidelines, but they can actively encourage people to go after their sponsors.

@Nicholas_DeOrio I found it fair criticism. I fucked up and it's what happened.

No matter what side your on. You shouldn't be okay with YouTube removing criticism videos on their vague guidelines.
@TheArchfiend The fact that you can find some snuff/sex footage on the platform still and have this be taken down as a priority says something.

dude @Leafy has his new video monetized, Susan's on her day off lol.
Ricky films some nasty shit. 
The one where i laughed
My dad saw the meme of my reaction superimposed on 9/11.
@JohnScarce @ChrisRGun No no, don't take it back. We're all a little gay for Chris.
"I woke up with a hangover after drinking a bit too much. I wrote a whole script that's like two hours long for a metal gear solid video.

I'll turn on the camera in a second."
RT @Gokanaru : Big respect to @MoistCr1TiKaL for giving me full credit in his newest video, the Voldemort curse has been lifted :] 
@NexpoYT I wanna join
no 
"Most of these modern day equality folk don't realize that we end up living in a scenario where people are more divided than ever.

I don't deny the world has problems but it's to a point where it seems day by day it's about putting people against each instead of the opposite."
How was "most gamers are white supremacists" misinterpreted? What context do you add to make that statement better? 
I got a video tomorrow watching out for all my Mac homies out there &lt;3
RT @MoistCr1TiKaL : GFuel likely never watched your video, employees were doxed and flooded with demands to drop him. Keem has done fucked up shit but nothing you presented was new. What was new was implying people should attack his sponsor, which is a bad precedent since anyone can do that now 
@ColossalisCrazy This is terrible for people who aren't even involved in the drama to begin with, imagine channels getting their sponsors removed because people pull out of YouTube en masse.
"Going after a creators sponsors is a terrible thing.

It's an incredibly low blow and it tends to snowball into apocalypse that blowback onto you. Plus it's pretty petty to do."
@LeonLush I'm gonna start calling you names on the internet. Let's see them hands.
Pokimane has some solid porn choices ngl.
@NetNobody I'll watch dad
I just hope Etikas resting in a good place.
@zaptiee She's cute bro real happy for you.

"@JustinWhang It has no be one or the other dude.

2020 no middle ground."
YouTube's getting spicy this year. 
Take the red pill.
"I hate what Ubisoft is doing to Rainbow Six Siege over the years.

The games going from a title that had proper hard counters and needed team comps. A meta that shifted per season to a game that resembles a 5v5 search and destroy match from CoD. With lame new gadgets and nerfs."
"Real talk, if you buy subs to get higher on the YouTube leaderboards.

You're pretty sad. You're literally in the game for all the wrong reasons."
Why buy subs when you can buy Ela elite skins.
I actually like playing Fallout 76 lately.
"Have a video on this kernel mode Bethesda anti-cheat.

@KavosYT Jesus. This really pisses me off, how low do you have to go to clickbait actual abuse. Fuck these cunts.
@KavosYT I wanna see him talk his way out of this lol
The pokimane simp memes are pretty funny.
@SM_Creepshow Man seems like all she needed to do was not... like... draw attention to it...
@SM_Creepshow What.
"We should ban all video games.

No online voice chat = no racism.

It's just a fact."

"Ever wake up and just think to yourself.

Am I a deer?"
@JustinWhang And this is what Twitch hires lol.
These people could never survive a Halo 3 lobby back in the day. 
@M101News Same
Sound logic and reasoning. 
@DonHaci What kind of crack is this person smoking and where do I find some.
"I like Twitch as a platform they do a lot of things right. I only ever had a gripe that the moderation wasn't treated fairly for each user.

If they can crack that then I can see them being a truly unrivaled platform."
Seriously whats with the new Twitch safety staff? Seems like an interesting concept in site moderation.
What the fuck. 
Im not throwing any software under the bus btw. Tubebuddy, VidIQ or socialblade or any software may have a vulnerability. I urge them to look into it if thats the case. Once again this is my best guess.
"Why I think this is because so far posts are being made by compromised channels but no deleting of user videos which would be easy to do in theory if someone was worming in Googles Databases so to speak.

Careful who you give third-party access to on your accounts."
"I have a video on this Logan channel coming out tommorow. To give the advice here quickly though.

You might want to disable any extension software on your YouTube channels like Tubebuddy.

Seems like an Oauth Token leak somewhere."
"This is personal. You club penguin fucks think i got paid off for making that video.

How about own up to your shit and take some fucking responsibility. You're acting younger than the people your owner alleged to diddle.

RT @KavosYT : UPDATE: Club Penguin Online becomes Club Penguin Offline as the site is officially down. 
"I've just been told Disney went DMCA with Club Penguin Servers a few hours ago.

"People that cheat on you are the worst. Never be sad about it cause you dodged those bullets.

Things always end up for the better."
@RealBowserman She give you a discount on the sub at least?
I loved the video i made yesterday. But im cooling it with content like that for a long time. Its not good for mental health and for the next few months i just wanna look at some shit online and have some fun.
Imagine how fucked it is when a bunch of kids find their moms naked on onlyfans 20 years later.
@twomad i saw that.
@JustinWhang Stop searching up my dad
Stay strong homies. 
@DDsulzbach Start aimbotting.
"Unpopular opinion but @KEEMSTAR has really helped me out the last couple of weeks on YouTube and in general behind the scenes.

@SM_Creepshow You make good content and it pairs well when editing.
Happy birthday @SM_Creepshow

Can't believe this Joji fellow could have filmed himself pimping wheelchairs. Seriously disgusted rn lol and im gonna report all this to internet police.
"Real talk how does the community seriously allow imallexx after all this pedo allegation BS.

Its never cool to accuse individuals of such a heinous crime and laugh it off later."
Say what you will but he's honest about his target demographic. 
snippet from the new club penguin investigation video. 
For the good people that we're blocked. 
Imagine admitting to this. 
@KavosYT Fuck em is what i say.
Btw these are what you get when the ads arent even set to personalized. This is just generic google ad placement nowadays.

"The shit ive heard behind the scenes on this club penguin private server is some sickening and highly criminal shit.

The fireflies hid the reality of their experiments in the original game until you get to the end. Did we play the same game?

"@DDsulzbach You end up getting used to the flavour. Think of it like beer. Its terrible at first but eventually it does grow on you.

@M101News To also claim with these. Jason hasn't explained how a hacker has an up to date dev system with what appears to be multiple builds of the game. Hackers cant just have all the stars align like that for real.
@M101News The mans on full defcon damage control for this game and its kinda funny.
"Last of Us 2 is really sad to see. Its like Naughty Dog forgot what made the first game was the relationships built upon the way.

This new game seems to ignore all of that and push for an agenda that's so unneeded in a zombie game.

Just sad the direction it's taken."
@KavosYT Man some people i know on twitch and i watch fucking cry and are so genuinely thankful at like 10 subs. But then you got this female DSP literally not even thankful over 100 people liked her content enough to contribute monthly. This is just saddening to watch.
@Rainbow_Nerd012 Imagine everything sounding like your underwater and your blood spurting all in your body with you shaking rapidly.
Seizure episodes last about 5 to 10 seconds. It hasn't been life threatening but its concerning why it's popping up now.

RT @CSGO : We have reviewed the leaked code and believe it to be a reposting of a limited CS:GO engine code depot released to partners in late 2017, and originally leaked in 2018. From this review, we have not found any reason for players to be alarmed or avoid the current builds.

"Btw for the CSGO stuff. Their is a video floating around with some dude showing a rootkit install. Thats not real since im sure the dude is trolling with batch scripts.

@BregerDaniel Yeah good cool. The institute of wuhan domain def sent out a breach of data warning but working in enough sectors that usually is a knee jerk reaction sometimes.
@bruhmoment120 @SelfFelacio I dont really believe this for the most part with the password sets used but its a rabbit hole to go down.
@BregerDaniel Im thinking its more and more of that because of these password sets. Would be a killer op to cover tho lol
Im looking more into this myself right now. But initial notes is that i do believe this may be a troll since most IT teams won't let you use "123456" as a password.
@SelfFelacio These are login and passwords used and burned hours ago to sign in to numerous key locations and then used to download as much documentation as possible.

@jessix_tv Whoever does it first will get the record for highest concurrent twitch viewers lol
Twitch is making this category because advertisers don't want ads on hot tub content. So the category is basically the equivalent to marking yourself as limited ads on YouTube's self certification survey
"RT @Twitch : We have an update on all things Hot Tubs, ad pauses, and content preferences. Read the blog to learn more:

RT @FrizeUwU : Yeah, who would have thought that nuggets are freaking delicious.

Most Let's Play channels are in this state right now. It's because they never adapted to the changing YouTube landscape. You can't just title videos "Super Mario 64 - Episode 14" and expect to get views like it's still 2013 
The video is long too. I clicked on it when I came out, watched for 5 minutes then put it in my watch later. If other people did that too, it would have butchered their view retention and the video would be recommended less as a result of that.
I understand the concern if your channel is underperforming but telling your audience about it is weird, especially when most people watching would kill for 160k views in 4 days
When you get a 10 of 10 video

here's Trisha's response to the bad clips of her resurfacing 
"to be clear, I'm only calling out Trisha from a hypocrisy and lack of self-awareness angle

I don't think she is currently problematic in the same ways she was from back in 2013, 2015"
he'll do "Twitter Archeology" on James talking about armpit hair but not on Trisha saying she wants to fly out and date a 16 year old in a tweet from the same year as James

well the new allegation happened in November. so it was before the older allegation from February came out 
this is all assuming the DMs are real of course
if he's genuinely stumbling across a bunch of minors who lie about their age on accident (the accidentally part is looking less and less likely by the day) he would just stfu, block and move on asap while feeling guilty but instead he rages at them and then does it again

i don't get or agree with those people either man 
@MRragreynolds i personally disagree
to compare it to LGBT. it's the difference between watching a movie/playing a video game with a homophobic character in it and buying/wearing shoes that say "fuck all f****ts"
"I'm also not saying that all fictional depictions of devils/demons is an attack on Christianity.

games like Bayonetta are all about Demons and I'm fine with it cause it's fiction and not anti-jesus

but the shoes have bible verses and references to biblical Satan. its different"
"We should be respectful of all types of people. black, gay, trans, Asian, Christian, Muslim, jew, etc.  

There's a lot to dislike Christianity for but selling merch that promotes hatred towards them is not the way. 

you can uplift LGBT+ without attacking Christianity"
"as someone who is progressive but also Christian, I've been conflicted about the lil nas controversy but I've recently come to a conclusion.
I don't have an issue with his song/video but the shoes is going way too far. it's the equivalent of selling shoes that say ""fuck all f*gs"""

@SociableBarely all of the people I mentioned tho do drama or accossate with big drama creators
that or I actually am a bad person compared to these bigger creators and I'm not self-aware enough to know how I come off as yet. idk
this is why I dislike Poki H3 NerdCity etc. they just dismissed me has a bad person and cut off ties with me because I had a different opinion/didn't do what they wanted. worst part is if I had more subs it would be different cause I've seen them make amends with bigger creators
in life nobody is treated fairly and I just need to fully come to terms with that even though it's hard for me to understand why (this is the reason racism, homophobia, transphobia, etc exists after all)

Messaging someone at 18, then meeting them at 22 when 30 and having sex isn't pedophilia. I hate people who throw that term around so willingly."
@TheQuartering here's the source 
"RT @Bowblax : oh, they met in Sep 2013 (non-sexual introduction) and she turned 18 a month later in October 2013.

people are unironically calling Dan a pedo and groomer for fucking a 22 year old in his 30s
ok time to watch more game grumps
@GaugeTheRoom if Dan met this girl at 18 and then they fucked when she was 22 and it was consentual. how is that grooming? what makes it grooming?

@GaugeTheRoom so any consensual sex with an adult that they regret later is grooming?
you cant groom someone who you met when they were 18 
"power dynamic arguments üôÑ

who made it law that youtubers can't have any sexual relations with someone who's watched their videos? "
"the reason it's coming out now as an accusation is because she's mad she got ghosted

but it makes sense considering Dan entered a long term relationship with someone else shortly after"
"oh, they met in Sep 2013 (non-sexual introduction) and she turned 18 a month later in October 2013.

They ended up fucking in December 2017 when she was 22

someone close to me was groomed, I know what it looks like and James is not that as far as i can tell"
there's a huge difference between someone like Lionmaker and James Charles but people act like they're the same
"@kaozbender_ sending nudes to a child knowing that they're one VS sending them while thinking they're 18+ are different

both are bad but one makes you stupid and the other makes you a pedo"
"criticize James, rip into him for his carelessness and stupidity. nobody should give him a free pass in that regard. but constantly calling him a sexual predator who preys on children is overboard with the current knowledge we have.

this is how dramagedon happened in 2019"
"idk why people are acting like the latest incident is solid enough to call him a predator off of

if James is proven to be a predator, I'll call him one but as of now all we know is that he's careless. a predator wouldn't ask for someone's age and say no if they respond under 18"

Nick when he called Swan to confront him on his lie 
not trying to victim blame here btw, idk who's right or wrong in the situation yet. so I'm asking genuine questions I have
plus if Seth is embarrassed about the situation and the video it happened in is now removed, doesn't bringing it back up put this back in the spotlight? invalidating the entire reason he wanted it removed?
I've been trying all morning and all last night to try and get to the original video and I couldn't. unlisted is essentially removed if it's not in a playlist 
@Johnny2Cellos congrats! I just found your channel yesterday and already watched like 5 videos. im hooked
if David apologized to Seth and he took down the kissing prank video already, prior to Seth coming out with his story. What does Seth want David to do? What more can David do?

@plushman11 @Nintend0babe @BanishedJourno doesn't help her narrative. she WANTS me to be racist
@RayareReviewing one take too
"in private, in 2016 (pre-Floyd) with clear satirical intent.

I wasn't racist then, just edgy and I'm sure as hell not like that now. once the song was leaked. I was apologized for it and took accountability for my dumb joke being seen by others.

I'm very liberal and support BLM "
"yikes. trying to pin someone as a racist but making a clearly satirical and private (that got leaked) song from 2016 that I made?

the people you're defending by ""calling me out"" said N word publicly back then too. so by your logic they're racist but obviously they're not. stop "
"@BanishedJourno @Nintend0babe it was also made in private in 2016.

if we're playing that game, people like BionicPig who openly said N word at that point is more guilty. but nobody here is racist, so it's dumb to play that game.

I used to be edgy but I've NEVER in my live been a racist"
@BanishedJourno @Nintend0babe kinda fucked that she would just assume I shit talk black people when I never have
"??? My 2016 song was talking shit about everyone who wasn't black???

the song is literally called ""black Live Matter, Other Live Don't"" "
@BionicPIGtv after we DMed I know know why you banned BLM but at the time it made no sense to me, people who never talked about zaptie who said blm in any capacity were getting banned. it was weird and confusing
RT @iNabber69 : actually, trans women are awesome epic women
i remember the only thing I typed in BionicPig's chat "why is blm being banned" and insanely got banned. so weird
"Don't remember anybody calling you racist but yeah banning blm in chat was weird af lol

@nicholasdeorio the tweet wasn't meant to be nuclear lol just saying how i feel
RT @gamerfrommars : John Swan can't be guilty; he was picking up boulders with his daughter when this all went down.
"here's another thing that bothers me about the John Swan stuff that is specific to me.
John talked with me in-depth explaining how the ""12 year old"" using his discord was autistic and exploited my knowledge of autism to craft his false narrative. I hate that I was used for that"
Methylphenidate is such a blessing for my ADHD ass mind
@PunishedProject making a 13 page google doc on it tho
@PunishedProject im so mad bro
RT @PunishedProject : wtf did I wake up to 
RT @SubToOptimus : I can't believe that John Swan also stood idly by and continued the lie while CordWit was legitimately receiving death threats and was being tortured online. That's one of the most damning parts of all of this. That and the fact he tried to pin it on an autistic 12-year-old. Fuck
@nicholasdeorio @AugieRFC @ExedPanda 
I know the Google doc was released after I defended him. But what was in that doc was similar to what he told me in private when this went down. To lie about a story with that much detail over something so small didn't make sense to me. Theres no rational reason to lie about that
"People who are acting like John Swans story was impossible to believe and we would have to be extremely biased to believe him are dumb af

he made a 13 page in-depth Google doc with compelling reasoning to his story bring true, it's insane to go to those lengths just to lie"
"Makes a tweet saying the entire commentary community blindly followed John Swan. I respond and she says ""it's just twitter"" and ""it doesn't apply to you"".

Lol don't make stupid statements if you can't back them up "
"@lleah101 You're mixing hyperbole with an actual critique. In the tweet you just showed that's purely a hyperbolic joke. Do you not see the difference? Lol

Don't blame me for not being able to decipher your true opinion from your exaggerated statements that exist in the same tweet"
@lleah101 Unreasonable
@lleah101 You said everybody in the commentary community blindly believed him. Don't act like it's unreadable for me to assume you're talking about everybody in the community
@lleah101 You said "commentary community" how does that not apply to me too? Lol

@SubToOptimus Ikr

@FakecelKiller @WillyMacShow @nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision when did i say it was petty? source?
@WillyMacShow @nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision yeah, so idk what your point is here. we didn't ignore the situation and talked about when it happened so....
@BigMoneyOnision @AugieRFC @WillyMacShow @nicholasdeorio ok well at least we can pinpoint where we disagree specifically. that's a lot further than most disagreements online get to.
@WillyMacShow @nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision it's not like I've ignored it. we all discussed it when it happened last month (or whenever it was, I forget exactly which month)
"@WillyMacShow @nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision for me with how my content is, it's worth a discussion on stream but not a full commentary from me.

which is what I did, this has been discussed many times on stream."
@AugieRFC @WillyMacShow @nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision I agree with your opinion but I also don't think John was lying or saying something he didn't believe just so he wouldn't have to apologize
@BigMoneyOnision @PyndrexLOL @WillyMacShow @nicholasdeorio i just see this as john giving bad advice. the guy isn't perfect just he's not being malicious here
"@WillyMacShow @nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision i dont remember him calling pieman a pedo.

as for suicide baiting. it makes sense how he came to that conclusion even though I heavily disagree with it. it's a point to critize him on for sure but it's not a big enough mistake to get up in arms and make a video for me personally"
@PyndrexLOL @WillyMacShow @nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision was it John who said that or someone else? you're saying "they" but I'm only talking about John here
@WillyMacShow @nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision it would be a point to add against someone at most. I can't see myself making a video just because DefNoodles told Pieman to take a break from the internet

by that logic, any video with "coco" in the title should be banned if it's not made for kids

what 
"RT @OrdinaryGamers : Yo Nintendo stop being bitches and give us twilight princess/windwaker HD on the switch.

Make that fat collection and sell for a day idc."
facts 
to put common insults like retard, idiot and stupid on a similar level to f and n slur, devalues those words imo.
"you can use it an ableist ways like demeaning someone disabled by calling them retarded but the word is most often used to describe anything that's dumb. like ""this thing is retarded"".

where as words like ""f******"" and ""n*****"" are majority of the time used to demean gay/black"
it's not ableist to use the word retard
so according to you, your hero Dream is openly working with homophobes and ableists??? yikes. time to stop stanning dream

5th Anniversary of Splatoon. also 3 games "
funny how the direct didn't actually start until 45 mins in with Skyward Sword HD
im still working on the video today but I took the morning to decompress from yesterday so it might not be out until tomorrow
bunty king was right. ricky is a pos! 
"RT @KavosYT : As far as people who I‚Äôve interviewed goes @dream was a great guest.

He stuck around and just chatted after we were done even though we shot over an hours worth of footage. 

We disagree a lot and still have very different views but was a pleasure to deal with"
what if it's announced in the direct üëÄ 
@KavosYT looking forward to seeing it :)
@KavosYT what's your stance on the story after talking with dream?
might delay Twitter VS Dream and John Sawn part 2 till tomorrow. Got really burnt out yesterday making 2 videos and doing after hours.

@JohnSwanYT stop talking to nick. he's a bad influence
"RT @OrdinaryGamers : Instagram removed my account for ‚Äúimpersonation‚Äù, now they want a photo ID?

Zuckerburg you can eat my hairy ass the day I give you fucking government id over your shitty social networks lol"
@JohnSwanYT @AugieRFC ratio #dreamtwt
John Swan needs to stop trolling Dream and get back on Game Grumps
John Swan peaked with his Flex Tape video
i have a solution 
RT @Bowblax : 
also if you have an opinion opposite to mine, it means my opinion didn't change yours. so who cares lmao
"for people who're stupid. reading tweets from both sides word for word = no bias. segment of video with ""my opinion"" in it = bias.

make sense?"
yep there's bias in a video where I have a segment titled "My Opinion" you got me dude haha  
odyssey 2 
even though I still believe John Swan. After watching Dream's stream and seeing more context, I don't think Dream was intentionally lying. So I changed the title from "slanders" to "calls out" to reflect this 
@SubToOptimus how dare you miss this tweet! you biased hack
RT @InfernoOmni : heads up if i don‚Äôt hit a million subs on YouTube by the end of Black History Month i‚Äôm playing the racism card you‚Äôve been warned
the one tweet you tacked on to the end of a thread 20 mins after already replying. makes sense that I would miss it. also it's consistent with John's story. He said the kid messaged 3 people on John's account and one person on the fake Dream account 
I missed that tweet. my bad on that. but it's stupid to call me biased when I literally read/show 8 minutes straight of your tweets against john swan, which I believe is all of them besides the one you just pointed out. lol 
"RT @KavosYT : In regards to Dream Vs John Swan

- John swans story has some inconsistencies that he needs to clarify ASAP

- Dream has a lot of weak arguments he‚Äôs focusing on way too much (grammar, use of sarcasm and specific words)

Overall I doubt we will ever find out the truth"
double upload?
render says 38 mins left but im hoping it will be faster than that
@JustinWhang @AugieRFC i agree but given how much stress he must be under have a dedicated stream on him with 300k viewers. I dont blame him
yup
new video in 30 mins
@KEEMSTAR I think you would have conducted the interview fairly (let him speak his peace fully with no cuts/interruptions) and told him to go on. but I respect his decision to not go on if that's what he thinks is best for him

LOOOOOOOOOOOOL 
@nicholasdeorio DREAM SAID YOUR NAME!!! LOOOL
RT @SubToOptimus : Dream has yet to concretely prove that the account wasn‚Äôt breached by the way. His damning evidence so far literally has been the usage of the words ‚Äúyup‚Äù and ‚Äúmate‚Äù, both extremely common words especially in a place like Australia.

the amount of times i've pressed "prt sc" in the last 30 mins
RT @SubToOptimus : As someone who has personally spoken to John Swan several times/collaborated with him I genuinely don‚Äôt believe he‚Äôd do what Dream is accusing him of publicly. The fact that he‚Äôs spun this to make John look like a bad person goes against everything I‚Äôve ever seen from John.
@Riot_Kassadin @realExate this is you
me 
@dreamwastaken @JohnSwanYT why on earth wouldn't you believe him? there's legit no motive to act like this. anyone who's spoken with John Swan can tell you it's not in his character to spam n word and weird 12 year old boy humor???
@JohnSwanYT With a dream post, when put in front of the right audience it could blow up in an instant. Best to get out ahead of it

@Job4_2 True enough. Most of the people I‚Äôve tried to help aren‚Äôt even earning money because they don‚Äôt want to be monetized or are too small, which means they don‚Äôt have access to the minimal resources monetized channels get.
@Job4_2 Yeah I understand that, but I don‚Äôt have any faith in DMCA reform. IMO YouTube is comically understaffed and has the resources to hire and train employees to make reasonable judgment calls. Maybe you could get a side gig telling people to eat shit for them?
@Job4_2 I‚Äôve helped a few people have strikes manually removed without appeal. They will occasionally use discretion, but not often.

I think the worst part of Lindsay Ellis‚Äôs video is that she pretended to drink like 12 shots of whisky and acted like it had no effect. I‚Äôve been abusing alcohol my entire life to be able to drink an exorbitant amount without acting drunk, and I don‚Äôt appreciate the appropriation
@Grimkaizer I mean I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs worth more than I paid for it at least. I‚Äôm not expecting a fortune or anything.
@mjarbo Nice, I thought they were really well done.
I have two large binders of Yu-Gi-Oh and Pok√©mon cards at my grandmas house somewhere unless she threw them out that are probably worth god knows how much. I barely every touched them.

Perhaps one day the technology will emerge to repair my brain and I too will be able to become enlightened and find larping as a pedophile humorous. For now I‚Äôll settle with using my broken caveman brain to call a spade a spade. 
Ah yes pretending to be a pedophile, classic edgy humor and satire. If only I could be so smart and enlightened. 
To be honest the most humiliating portion of the video is where she sincerely takes a knee to Bob

@thekinocorner I guess. This is the first time I‚Äôve watched one of her videos
Ok I‚Äôm listening a bit more. She really does think she‚Äôs explaining Twitter and online culture using a sophisticated and academic approach, but in reality she sounds like an insane person who lives on the internet and never leaves her room.
I had to drop out shortly after she said black people invented the concept of canceling because of some random song in the 80s. Bitch has the IQ of a grape. Respectfully.
Does Lindsay Ellis really expect people to think she hasn‚Äôt been affected by being crucified by her own people when she said at a con that she had to check into a psych ward when right wing boomers mildly bullied her? That‚Äôs what I got from the five minutes I watched at least.
I bet there is a ghost Tweeter out there who specializes in crafting viral tweets and sells his services to internet hos so they can shill their onlyfans underneath them.

Either taking a vacation and being away from your computer instantly makes drama happen, or every YouTuber uses the same retarded lie when they get caught acting like a dumb ass.

@BuildsLord Yeah, he was pretty explicitly against it. I think kids that are within three years of each are other fine to date once they are in high school most of the time. The bigger concern is obviously literal baby rapists, as you pointed out. Hansen is just out of touch at this point.
@Job4_2 I vaguely remember you talking about that on MATI. When you say pod do you mean like a living space or is that a term for some sort of deviant behavior I‚Äôm not familiar with?
Wait what? For fucks sake I‚Äôm actually going to have to read his thread for this one. 
@BuildsLord I don‚Äôt have the clip on hand but during the height of TCAP he said in an interview that he wouldn‚Äôt even entertain that idea, and the guys at Perverted Justice had policies against it.

John Swan‚Äôs friends when they realized there was no 12 year old autistic child 
That accusation was correct and the jokes were hilarious. 
 
There is one key difference between Turkey Tom and John Swan, and it‚Äôs the fact that Tom did literally nothing wrong.
@zaptiee Pescatore shows up to Nick‚Äôs house and Tommy C repels off the roof in his ill fitting military uniform and drunkenly chases him down the street.

How are you going to get doxed? You operate under your real name, Einstein. 
The internet also gets really fucking boring and it‚Äôs nice to be able to just fuck off and not force gay topics no one cares about.
If you are a YouTuber and you don‚Äôt have at least a skilled trade you can work at any time, you are retarded. This shit can disappear at any time for no reason, and going back to live with your parents after you‚Äôre 18 as a man is unacceptable and you should be bullied. 
In case anyone is wondering the reason I can say retard and not get banned is because I work for the federal government.
I‚Äôve enlisted the help of an autistic 12 year old hacker who is penetrating John Swan‚Äôs mainframe as we speak. Leaks to come.

interesting how like 5 years ago it was just the norm to shit on girls like zoie burger without question for being titty streamers, and now its completely the opposite
@zoggyt doubt it

Currently starting work on a project that I haven't talked about in years - back in the day it was one of my more controversial videos to the community. A lot has changed since then and I think it's time to finally do the digibro video.

@FappingFlamingo yesh

@KEEMSTAR @nicholasdeorio @AugieRFC thank you
Had to delete all of my tweets because a copyright troll who has targeted @nicholasdeorio and @AugieRFC is now targeting me. They managed to DMCA takedown a tweet only containing a link to my own podcast. Nick is now suspended. This is beyond fucked.
@becky16hill @nicholasdeorio @LordVega @KEEMSTAR i got it too
"RT @nicholasdeorio : Def Noodles paired a gotcha post with edgy jokes to try further paint Keemstar as an anti-Semite. 

I understand the tolerance/willingness to defend edgy humor has dissipated due to optics but at the very least removing Keem saying he was joking 3x is why people hate this guy. "

@HarleyTBSYT 
I love how people assumed that I never called with John and told him to come forward and be honest lol 
@sdsatire you have literally no grasp on the situation do you.
@HarleyTBSYT All these DMs show is that John should be greatful for having someone as loyal as me as a friend
@HarleyTBSYT @JohnSwanYT They all person who isn't lying here seems to be nick, clout chaser and flip floper? seems about right
@HarleyTBSYT jesus christ no wonder nobody likes you.
@CordWit good guy cordwit
@TalkSchitAvenga @KavosYT It has been called nick for a while because I used to trick john into dragging me up in a vc on his server when he was live. But it didn't work. It wasn't called nick to make dream think nick was involved.
@zentimal_ @DiaryTabletop @WillyMacShow John would be in as much shit if I would've just dropped a tweet about it before he could take accountability himself lol.
@zentimal_ @DiaryTabletop @WillyMacShow Yes i did talk to John multiple times about this of course. Of course I wanted John to tell the truth because I wanted to take credit for the "sex mod" jokes and stuff lol
@zentimal_ @DiaryTabletop @WillyMacShow thats his decision lol. speak to him about it not me.
@JediNabber I watched it a while ago and it was really good. Seems just like an actual genuine guy who screams loud occasionally
@dumpylol when the puck in hockey goes into the hockey goal resulting in a hockey win
@Immy_Darko he does actually have a manager
joe biden 
@angxelina Because everyone already knows that lol
@ClickedTazer I own that account not john, all the messages were from me 
@KavosYT I legit own the account and take full responsiblity for the messages. John had no control over the messages I sent. 
Worst thing to come of this is that it wasn't "Dream's sex mod" it was "LtCobra's sex mod" the entire time
@JamesMarriottYT Don't worry I'm still working on it
@HarleyTBSYT @InternetUnwind it was me who said the n word and it was most likely at the time john said, deleted that
@ItzRoosterYT it's happening again 
@Dream About that minecraft sex mod guys...
@dazeLUL @GayAreZee Real
@BluesDank @phantom_cash Rock
@DiaryTabletop @WillyMacShow You do realise that if John thought he could get away with it then I have no obligation to come forward to ‚Äúsave his reputation‚Äù. In actuality, had I come forward it would‚Äôve made John look even worse as it wasn‚Äôt him coming out and telling the truth himself
@lachylannn @WillyMacShow 
@DiaryTabletop @WillyMacShow 
@WillyMacShow Alright lol
@phantom_cash @BluesDank
@WillyMacShow Of my funniest trolls.
@WillyMacShow Wait hold on. Willymacshow? We you sitting in me and John‚Äôs calls all this time? Did you know what was going on ‚Äúbehind the scenes‚Äù , why are you pretending that I never told John just to tell the truth lol. Of course I wanted him to tell the truth because it was one
@jakontrary Soon
@WillyMacShow Never told John to double down at any point lol. I just did what was in his interest at the time to help my friend. I understand if you wanted me to stick a knife in the back of my friend and ruin a friendship for the sake of some internet points but I‚Äôm not that type of person
@WillyMacShow I protected to him because he‚Äôs my friend lmao.
@WillyMacShow Use your brain and think ‚Äúwhy would I come out and backstabbed a guy I‚Äôve been good friends with for 2 years?‚Äù. Like do you not think I wanted to tell the truth because I had no issue with me and John trolling so I would‚Äôve happily owned up. But since John lied to dream
"And if you more concerned over the idea that Me and John would ‚Äútroll‚Äù dream, then I take full responsibility on that matter because it was my idea

thank you to the YouTubers who have me muted on Twitter but have been talking about the ‚Äúsex mod‚Äù I was developing. "
@JeIIieh Woa woa
"I‚Äôm not going to back stab a good friend over something so insignificant. I‚Äôm sorry if your disappointed in me not telling everyone the truth or what, I‚Äôm just hoping you can understand morally why I never came forward.

Okay, now back to funny tweets"
Personally, and I think I told John this, i would‚Äôve just told dream the truth because it was a nothing burger, but I think John just sort of panicked because he‚Äôs quite uptight in situation like this. And of course because of this I never came out to tell the truth because
Pretended he was good friends with dream and sent Harley dreams discord account, in which it was me on the account. This was simply just to troll Harley for shits and giggles. It was quite a while ago but I remember John telling dream it wasnt him or something.
Due to the fact John‚Äôs has just come out about the dream situation it‚Äôs probably about time I stated why I defended John despite knowing what actually happened. HarleyTBS is a pretty cringe kid and was messaging John about dream, so I thought it would be funny if John

@PyndrexLOL @aidinmp3 @WillyMacShow I don't think John ever called him a pedophile, but what he did say is that it was fucked for him to say that and I agree. Anyone in tune with the outside world could see that, I don't think he's attracted to children but a 15 yearold saying that about a 12 yearold is weird af
@PyndrexLOL @aidinmp3 @WillyMacShow you'd certainly get your head kicked in for that sorta stuff at my school
@PyndrexLOL @aidinmp3 @WillyMacShow I dont know if its because all of this americans have been home schooled and shit, but 15 and 12 to be is wrong and i have no issue with pieman being hell acountable for that. 3 year age this 3 year age cap that, its not 18 and 21, 42 and 45, 15 and 12 is quite a dif at that age
@PyndrexLOL @aidinmp3 @WillyMacShow I think a 15 yearold being attracted to a 10 yearold is incredibly predatory lol. Power dynamic there is off the scale.
@HarleyTBSYT "I will never touch a serious topic again"
@aidinmp3 @WillyMacShow at what point does that argument fail at tho. How young would a person have to be before you would hold pieman accountable?

@Hankiepankie20 @AugieRFC doesn't take much to quote my mans tweet and send love considering they listen to everything he says.
@AugieRFC On a moral standpoint I'd want dream to open up the bird app and send love cordwit's way tbh due to the fact that his audience are telling cordwit to kill himself whilst sending the thread cordit made on his friend who committed suicide.
@HarleyTBSYT and the kid just read the message.
@HarleyTBSYT just seems like a stab in the dark or me and john might've messaged about it before
@HarleyTBSYT I message with John almost everyday, it's highly likely that I was one of the people John last messaged that day. Kid probs just pulled up any name on the direct message list and I was probs the most recent.
@AugieRFC it's legit 6am for him and he hasn't slept. But knowing John swan his manager actually did advise him not to. Don't see this as john coping out. trust me
@KavosYT lol
I'm not like trying to have some get out of jail card but the last couple of days in my personal life i've been some of the worst of my life. People I've spoken to personally will know this, can we just like wait a few weeks and then you can chat shit about me lmao

@DocOnTheRadio They‚Äôre prob making an example out of her in all honesty
If you‚Äôre selling sex just be honest about it. If that‚Äôs not where Twitch wants to take their platform, then you already knew you were exploiting TOS for mass gains. It‚Äôs an obvious risk/reward
I‚Äôll be honest, if I was showing the outline of my dick on YT every upload, I probably wouldn‚Äôt be too surprised if I lost ads. Being sexually suggestive is outlined in their TOS and while they should‚Äôve issued a warning, it‚Äôs not like these creators don‚Äôt know about the rule.

Seeing people constantly slander EE really pisses me off. He‚Äôs one of the few respectable creators you guys have left and his heart is in the right place. If you keep eating each other, who‚Äôs dick are you gonna suck? There‚Äôs no longevity in a community that doesn‚Äôt care about you
@ricklesTV I can agree with that at least. In the case of ZeRo, he actually can‚Äôt get real jobs because of background checks so it‚Äôs really tricky to say what‚Äôs the ‚Äúproper‚Äù thing to do even if he regrets his actions. People don‚Äôt seem to consider necessary things like income to survive.
@zaptiee How is getting darker gonna help me sleep?
@zaptiee I haven‚Äôt slept. Idk why but now my sleep schedule will be fucked
@ricklesTV @ChiChi3667 I think it‚Äôs fair if people don‚Äôt like him for the Skype messages, but this discord thing is because he‚Äôs been isolating himself and doesn‚Äôt have much contact with anyone these days. It‚Äôs an attempt in coordination with his therapist to maintain a healthy support group
@ricklesTV @ChiChi3667 Her twitlonger stated that all posts had been cleared by the victims with their expressed permission and she‚Äôs on record stating multiple times that she‚Äôd never put other people‚Äôs stories unless it was what they wanted. Make of that what you will
@ricklesTV @ChiChi3667 And that‚Äôs fair to be upset at, but Jisu openly attacked ZeRo for this and Baenessa was forced to make a statement through Omni. She still didn‚Äôt get the message until she personally DM‚Äôd her about removing it. She said it ‚Äúwas in the heat of the moment‚Äù and apologized.
@ricklesTV @ChiChi3667 You know it‚Äôs impossible for anyone but Jisu to get them right? Everyone else was anonymous. So that‚Äôs just ‚Äúvictim‚Äù. She also lied about Baenessa‚Äôs age and added a rumor about her without her consent, which resulted in her trauma, but I guess that‚Äôs cool since Jisu‚Äôs a victim.
@KrebsTLegend They think he‚Äôs gonna use it to groom kids or some shit. As if he wouldn‚Äôt be under a microscope. I have more to say on the topic, but Twitter limits don‚Äôt do anything justice
@JarraSSB @Floorcina @ricklesTV That‚Äôs not a defense. That‚Äôs all ZeRo did to Jisu. That‚Äôs an objective fact. Plz go read what you‚Äôre yelling about before u look even dumber
@Floorcina @JarraSSB @ricklesTV This guy is incapable of intelligent discourse. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs a useful idiot for others to use whenever they feel like it
‚ÄúWhy is no one checking up on the anonymous victims with no described identity? We need to make sure they‚Äôre fine as well!‚Äù
@JarraSSB @Floorcina @ricklesTV You‚Äôre shifting the convo cuz even you know Jisu‚Äôs story was bullshit LOL! No one is justifying anything. That‚Äôs just u assuming shit cuz someone didn‚Äôt 100% agree with your weird worship of people who clearly have motives. I got a wool coat that would fit you nicely
@JarraSSB @Floorcina @ricklesTV I don‚Äôt remember Jisu being that 14yr old. That‚Äôs so crazy bro tell me more
This kinda whataboutism is so fucking stupid. It‚Äôs not just some random wellness check. He literally attempted suicide and people wanted to make sure he was alright. This is very telling how self-absorbed people are. ‚ÄúI know he tried to kill himself, but what about ME??‚Äù 
@JarraSSB @Floorcina @ricklesTV God she‚Äôs so brave and strong. I can‚Äôt believe ZeRo showed her porn. We should salute her bravery. Erect statues in her honor even
@Eli1Mitchell He brought the point up in the first place entirely unprovoked. His 2nd tweet is about avoiding circumstances where that may occur, not how people use it as a shield from further criticism
@JohnRamsaur People threaten to assault me publicly on here. It‚Äôs not like a secret
Anyone who is posting about death threats they knew that they‚Äôd get, is more than likely doing it for sympathy. You think acknowledging them and posting it online is gonna make it stop??? You‚Äôre just validating them if anything. As if everyone involved doesn‚Äôt get them
Every public figure that speaks about controversial topics gets death threats. Why is this even a point people bring up? Would my arguments be more valid if I just screenshotted my death threats before every tweet? It‚Äôs so common for all parties that it‚Äôs honestly negligible

@leesgotasthma Yeah it‚Äôs just usually not possible with people who hate me for reasons they can‚Äôt explain. Too much effort at that point. I‚Äôm also an entertainer so it‚Äôs better to just have a bad guy vs good guy narrative if that‚Äôs what they want anyways
@AugieRFC It‚Äôs also expensive as fuck. Seems like such a waste of money if you aren‚Äôt constantly doing collabs
@leesgotasthma I‚Äôm glad you seem like a reasonable person on the topic. Extremism on both ends is always stupid, but it‚Äôs often impossible to find middle grounds on social media. Which is why it‚Äôs easier to just dunk on people or troll
@InfernoOmni Not everyone can have the love story we do Omni. If only the world was as perfect as the circumference of your dome...
@leesgotasthma I get Uncle Tom narratives, I just think it does a disservice to split communities rather than engaging in the points themselves. Excommunicating people for their beliefs just makes them more radical. That‚Äôs been proven time and time again in history
I give it 24hrs before an old guy lays in his own shit in the corner and it loses its health license 
@Bowblax No credits? Smfh
@leesgotasthma The issue is assuming everyone shares the same experiences and values based simply off their skin color. It inadvertently puts people into boxes and makes it fine to force your own experiences on to others to conform to a certain line of thought. Like only dating black women, etc
One thing I don‚Äôt get is how the word use to be exclusively a racial slur and a caricature of black people, but we managed to repurpose it so it‚Äôs not only racist when white people say it, but it can also be used between black people to degrade each other. Masterful play
This isn‚Äôt an exclusive thing to Twitter. If you aren‚Äôt black it‚Äôd definitely seem that way but it‚Äôs been around for awhile.

@SlushTV_ @thekinocorner I guess that makes sense as far as the shot, but at the end of the day it was a threat presented by Boogie and Frank called him on it. Idk if it‚Äôd make sense legally to indict the recipient of a warning shot.
@SlushTV_ @thekinocorner Frank‚Äôs entire content is making people uncomfortable and harassing them. Criticizing him for it will get nowhere
@StellaVindicta I mean you kinda have to fall under that category to do what Frank does, but from a troll perspective he‚Äôs hilarious. Boogie taking the bait and provoking him to come to his house and literally asking him to, is entirely his fault
@thekinocorner @TheXManStan @TaborTCU @25 Frank is hilarious
@writesoundmusic He played a game of chicken and lost. That‚Äôs all it looks like to me

I don‚Äôt get all the Boogie apologists when he directly fed into a guy who is literally known for fucking with people irl. Dumb as shit

Also Jay from Big Mouth is a VA for the coin throwing dude and I can‚Äôt get that out of my head everytime he shows up
@Xenoblade_Natsu They stretched out the motivation of a main antagonist so much so that it did more of a disservice to the show because instead of just doing a basic aside with Omni man and feeding you tid bits, they leave you in the dark. It‚Äôs confusing. Also not a fan of the relationships

@thecheatdotcom No one is upset at you for being cautious. You‚Äôre just insulting my intelligence for wanting to listen to the other side... Stop assuming this is all about returning to a fighting game instead of people‚Äôs livelihoods.
@thecheatdotcom That‚Äôs not what I said. I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs something that happened and is very recent. I think you‚Äôre more concerned about people coming back to a gaming community rather than introducing nuance and explaining their situations. U can‚Äôt understand why things happen if u don‚Äôt listen
@thecheatdotcom What would you do if the truth ended up being uncovered? Did you expect Nairo to come back and make thousands of dollars and have a tag trending in support? I think you underestimate the importance of nuance and listening before judging on your own, but that‚Äôs your choice.
@PlantRulx @DI_Exists Are you blind? That‚Äôs the entire purpose of the document

@InfernoOmni @O_Knee_San Lmao
@Captain_Crete @Check8813 She posted a legal cease &amp; desist while at the same time stating her info on the subject will remain private for court. That‚Äôs textbook taking legal action if I‚Äôve ever seen it so I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre probably wrong
@BrenFrancisco This actually makes 0 sense. No wonder it‚Äôs so easy to fuck with your community
@Check8813 Unless the clips are of Cinnpie fucking him on camera, I‚Äôm not gonna jump to conclusions when she‚Äôs building a case. I‚Äôm just gonna not make an opinion
"I see a lot of haters instantly saying, ‚ÄúLOOK AT TECHNICALS HOPPING TO DEFEND ANOTHER ABUSER LOL XD‚Äù 

First off, point out a single case I‚Äôve done that and been wrong on my conclusion. 

Secondly, I‚Äôm literally just waiting to see what she says. Calm tf down Jesus lol"
@CherriLoli Cuz it‚Äôs legal jargon. If it was a twitlonger I‚Äôm sure all those bases woulda been covered. She‚Äôs already gone so if nothing comes out of it you can just go about your day like normal
@CherriLoli I mean now we‚Äôve gone from, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs never addressed it‚Äù to ‚Äúit‚Äôs a tiny portion‚Äù. All I‚Äôm saying is wait to see what happens in court since she‚Äôs keeping information private anyways.
@blazeblaze27 @SargentLettuce She clearly can‚Äôt talk about everything cuz she‚Äôs planning to take legal action. Did we just forget how Nairo did the same thing a few months ago? 
@CherriLoli She addressed it in the very first line
@Charizard_Main I‚Äôm not concerned about what line of thought is safe. I just want to know why she‚Äôd post this and what she knows
@CherriLoli This document also alludes to more potential abusers tho. I wouldn‚Äôt be too quick to write off her account based solely off any of that
@bbone420 Not even sure I want to. More like forced to at this point
@bbone420 You‚Äôve been on Twitter for too long
@Federalhood @SargentLettuce Ya. Scroll up dumbass
I take new information in strides. If she actually has stuff working behind the scenes, I‚Äôm just gonna wait to see it. With how other things have played out, nothing surprises me at this point.
@MartelJoker @XZerenx @LiamLDZ @Cinnpie @WaDiRob This is just common sense tho
@SargentLettuce You don‚Äôt put ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù in a defamation cease &amp; desist. It‚Äôs not a twitlonger
Definitely didn‚Äôt expect a legal document this late stage, but let‚Äôs see what happens. 
RT @Cinnpie : 
I bet if I offered Risu $1,000 I could get her to say anything. Prob not even that much maybe like $500 and she‚Äôd turn into a Fiverr request on the spot. I gotta test this hypothesis
And I never ‚Äúthought‚Äù I‚Äôd get my money back. That‚Äôs why I did it in the first place. I know you‚Äôre a morally bankrupt parasite with almost no money to your name. In the face of that adversity, however, is when you can prove your integrity. You just happened to fail
She called me ableist for calling her out before for taking the handout from someone she thinks is a bigot. Idk if she actually knows anything about politics, but taking money from lobbyists and big corporations or the KKK, would generally make you more corrupt.

@CruelAnglthes_s I envy your ability to miss the point
Y‚Äôall desperately need reading rainbow and it shows
The day I encounter a smash player that actually addresses an issue without breaking down and crying, it‚Äôll be in person. None of these people have worthwhile opinions because I can guarantee while they‚Äôre attacking you, they only have a vague understanding of what‚Äôs going on.
@DistantKingdom Adult baby rage is an art form

@Headwipe_ I was shown this in a thread but ok. They‚Äôre the ones talking about me in the first place behind a block
@Fulkssie1 Yeah
Everybody make note that Leffen will deplatform people that disagree with him. Sounds pretty standard for Smash players if you ask me. I guess it‚Äôd be much harder to debunk any of my arguments or actually have self-awareness, so I can‚Äôt blame him. 
@Guwi_Mandrill I love this thread ty lol
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! NO WAY! This is your bad boy? You‚Äôre fucking joking me 
Some ‚Äúvillain‚Äù you were. Just take a seat until I‚Äôm done. You can cry later 
Leffen is such a fucking simp LOL
Common sense I‚Äôd imagine 
@Bowblax Yes
The important stuff is already archived. Only reason I‚Äôm saying any of this
@grimecka Leffen couldn‚Äôt argue himself out of a paper bag
Jisu is probably the most effective user of emotional manipulation in the community and I‚Äôm gonna enjoy proving it in great detail among other things.
I'm not even joking, but I think Jisu gets a dopamine rush from being an activist like this. You can tell because right after she "took out" ZeRo before a REAL story came out, she went full anime and even put "Batman" in her bio. I'm about to go fucking nuclear so plz chill 
@DI_Exists Don‚Äôt think so
The person least affected by ZeRo is having a fucking seizure because people are worried about him and random people said, ‚Äúthey want him back‚Äù. Give me a break
I think it‚Äôs just because you‚Äôre just being incredibly unlikeable. ‚ÄúIt was never about their mental wellbeing‚Äù, that‚Äôs literally the title. Stop playing these weird mental games to validate pushing someone to suicide.

@SlushTV_ Scientists are astounded at the potential infinite parallel realities in which Tariq has achieved catastrophic failure 100% of the time. This anomaly will go down as the biggest L in history for years to come.
I expect to see all of these ‚Äúempathetic‚Äù smash players jerking themselves off if God forbid, ZeRo follows through on anything. Don‚Äôt wanna reference any names, but y‚Äôall really didn‚Äôt learn shit. Human life isn‚Äôt worth you making another fucking sizzling ‚Äúhot take‚Äù.

We should honestly make a conscious effort to erase people‚Äôs existences when we‚Äôre done with them. It‚Äôs almost as cathartic as my favorite pastime of book burning. When will people learn?
Journalism that covers people or things I don‚Äôt like shouldn‚Äôt exist. When I see a Netflix document about criminals, I just punch my screen in anger. Don‚Äôt they know the person they‚Äôre platforming did a bad thing? Honestly disgusting and vile.

@nicholasdeorio Kudos to you. That shit sounds difficult
@brett_grisar I don‚Äôt doubt it
@nurquidation Yeah. It‚Äôs called ‚Äústop being fucking lazy and watch the full thing.‚Äù
Just finished the EE &amp; ZeRo interview. All I have to say is, keep this in mind when you‚Äôre all talking about the Sky House in a few weeks.
EE is a good dude trying to make sure people who care for ZeRo after the traumatic news, is still doing ok. No one should wish that kinda stuff on people so I can‚Äôt really blame EE for wanting to cover it. Smashers really be out for blood tho
Alright for the dumbasses in the replies. When I say disclaimer, from a journalistic standpoint it puts their unforgivable issue at the forefront and first states that this cannot be overlooked. I‚Äôm not talking about a sentence in the description. It‚Äôs called emotional appeal
@VeganDeep Ty good friend
I didn‚Äôt even get to see EE‚Äôs ZeRo interview, but knowing him he was probably doing something similar to his Ally video where he platforms their current situation and allows them to share their current mental state/affairs. It should be reuploaded with a disclaimer, not removed.

The people who agree with her are equally annoying and don‚Äôt actually give a shit about over half of what they‚Äôre talking about. If you gave them their own show I can guarantee it‚Äôd just be another tea channel with 0 substance just so they can talk shit while making money.
@SlayerStarX Nothing
The most disingenuous concern troll in Smash. Constantly misrepresents scenarios to dehumanize people and then cries ‚Äúharassment‚Äù when people are fed up with it. As long as you‚Äôre buying her ‚Äúcontent‚Äù tho she would even take money from the KKK. Go have a family or something Jesus

@Raykushi Easy to say that after contributing to multiple people‚Äôs downfalls
If I was playing nice, none of them would care. Your community responds to toxicity and lobbing accusations. So I play your game in reverse. That‚Äôs just how it works
I‚Äôm wondering if me being a dick is starting to wake up people in Smash. It‚Äôs true that literally ANYONE can do what I‚Äôm doing, the sad part is none of them care enough to try. You may think I‚Äôm morally bankrupt for profiting, but that‚Äôs the same reason they stay silent. Crazy

@MasKpls And? This is a straw man. I‚Äôve been very consistent on my views unless you can actually point something out which you haven‚Äôt. Which is normal. I already think a majority of your community is just sheep anyways for this exact reason
@MasKpls Yeah I agree. You act like I wouldn‚Äôt support having them all out
@MasKpls Ya, that would involve not having adults around that are so spineless they‚Äôd let their friends get black out drunk because they don‚Äôt wanna be a party pooper. If she didn‚Äôt wanna see this story she wouldn‚Äôt pin it to her profile and look at it every single day
@MasKpls I don‚Äôt claim to care about anything but the truth. Giving the power of society over to those that have been wronged wouldn‚Äôt create the utopia you think it is. The law doesn‚Äôt suddenly not matter because of someone‚Äôs retelling of their story
Also the fact that he frame 1 RT‚Äôd it lol 
These kind of responses that fully absolve him of any role is why I stated that it appears the relationship they had together contributed greatly to the bias involved in crafting this narrative.
You state in your twitlonger that he ‚Äúaccompanied‚Äù you to the party. He not only has a legal obligation to intervene, but to absolve him of ANY responsibility is an incredibly weird perspective. Especially if we‚Äôre talking about steps to make sure this never happens again.

@CassKittie @Mawlerz Thank god
@CassKittie @Mawlerz You definitely should not be in charge of any events in the near future
@CassKittie I‚Äôve never drank in my life as a matter of fact. You might be only able to focus on one subject at a time which is good for you, but for others it‚Äôs not a reach to call out things that directly result in sexual abuse and neglect. You do you
@lookingCoFiiine Until you don‚Äôt live in America, you should probably follow the laws in America. It‚Äôs a fucking gaming community. Not the senate floor
You can‚Äôt logically spark a debate on how to keep minors/underaged members of the community safe and then laugh at the prospects of providing alcohol to them in social settings. It‚Äôs a part of the Smash culture and it‚Äôs incredibly irresponsible and illegal.
That‚Äôs kinda the entire problem 
RT @IntroSpecktive : I think everyone in the community should look into the Anti case, because myself and many others wrote him off completely before everything was presented and he had a chance to speak. Moving forward it‚Äôs important to work on stay neutral and open. I apologize @ANTIWORLD666

@AkashicGaming @0verLade @MasKpls @Minstora_Gaming I have 0 problem with someone getting criticized by a community. Especially if that person is actively putting down someone who pretty much did exactly what they did. Call it karma or justice or whatever, but I call it consistency.
@ant_ssb I mean I personally contributed to both of their cases on a community wide scale so I think if anyone is allowed to make the comparison it‚Äôs me.
After I eat some food
I think I‚Äôll hold a discussion stream tomorrow to allow the info time to sit. In the meanwhile imma chill with the homies on the 2nd channel today
@ant_ssb @fireheart4560 She never said she was drunk...this is you filling in blanks yourself
@ant_ssb @fireheart4560 Ok that‚Äôs your opinion. I‚Äôd ask you to elaborate that with specific quotes and references if you truly think that.
She also didn‚Äôt say she was groomed or taken advantage of which would make sense when you consider she was lying the entire time.
"1) The Nairo comparison was that they were both lied to and widely skewed in the public view. 

2) Both ANTi and MVD did nothing to prevent the scenario that allowed underage drinking. These two are not different at all. 

3) The woman involved didn‚Äôt say she was drunk. "

@randomkandor ?
Absolute fuckin morons
With the way MVD is defending himself rn, you‚Äôd think he woulda been cool with ANTi‚Äôs case since he clearly doesn‚Äôt give a shit about the law LOL! People like this guy who have no remorse or self-reflection on underaged drinking are the reason it‚Äôs so prevalent in the first place
@AkashicGaming @0verLade @MasKpls @Minstora_Gaming I literally said verbatim, ‚Äúin the case of enabling underaged drinking, I find both MVD AND ANTi guilty‚Äù. You want me to crack down on the guy that already got death threats for it over the guy that was praised as a hero? Ya nah stfu lol

I can‚Äôt even upload like basic troll content, but 12yr olds can tell me to off myself like 10 times in the comments. Truly magnificent

Still following my initial time frame of a release next week
This script is kinda hittin‚Äô, but I usually don‚Äôt exert this much effort back to back cuz of the strain. I feel somewhat of an obligation to use the current growth to fix as much as possible tho before I go back to covering myself in peanut butter and hydro dipping rats.
@Master_Eth Yeah I‚Äôve already seen this. I would not be surprised if this was somehow setup too
@AnimeThighs_Val Don‚Äôt do him dirty like that lol

Absorber fakes like all of his shit. If you don‚Äôt get that shitty ass girl voice off my timeline 
When Nerd City and Colossal finally release their vid on Jaystation everyone‚Äôs gonna be like, ‚ÄúWow what a piece of shit! How does this guy have a plat-‚Äú

RT @RealYungCripp : calling out my fatphobic mother 
@Ablurman Yeah but I got other people following me that don‚Äôt give a shit. Kinda cringe
I‚Äôll admit I spazzed out a little replying to randoms on the timeline. It‚Äôs kinda fun ratio‚Äôing people who need to @ a discord to get interactions. Imma chill out and leave most of it on YT where it belongs tho until the next shitfest.
@CatChat240p Agreed
@GlinkLive @SlushTV_ We‚Äôll just head out then 
@SlushTV_ @GlinkLive You and fucking Glink lol
@GlinkLive @SlushTV_ Stop trying to reach enlightenment on the timeline. I‚Äôm trynna look at bitches

@Bowblax Maybe it‚Äôs because you gave Keemstar the Sharingan
I forgot about these mfs 
@nicholasdeorio Relatable
@OOHKAYEYE He‚Äôs growing
@RedFoxComms Especially if they come in there with their 10 followers talking about ‚Äúrelevancy‚Äù. Bitch, you‚Äôre on MY post
@Neoncaffeine It is and it‚Äôs fucking annoying. You deal with that shit your whole life if you‚Äôre black
I‚Äôll say it again. This dude has no place cancelling others and expecting to be praised for donating to BLM for a little bit. Let em know

@mogaku4 Nevermind. Squint
@mogaku4 I‚Äôll upload a better one

Someone sent me a Shiny ESAM Nigga moment from 2016 in his sub discord. This shit will never not be funny to me 
@GlinkLive Deep
@darko_ram You should work on your reading comprehension then
It‚Äôs not a fuckin tribe. If I don‚Äôt know you, you‚Äôre not suddenly my family cuz you have dark skin and similar opinions. If your ‚Äúkinship‚Äù is so fragile that a different opinion will excommunicate you, then I‚Äôd rather stay with my own family ty. More solid 
@SeanJac06731275 Nah relax lol
Guess he couldn‚Äôt respond 
Just because you jokingly hating white people is mainstream, doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt toxic. I treat everyone the same and don‚Äôt put race on a pedestal. Meanwhile, all you do is promote racial division with your rhetoric. You just lack self-awareness
@FireKing__ That‚Äôs not what he said at all.
Yeah and there‚Äôs people that hate white people ‚Äújoking‚Äù around in your communities too. You can find bad faith actors in every community possible. This isn‚Äôt a real argument 
Black people will really be upset at you for not being as emotionally unstable as them over a word. Nigga I gotta go make money and take care of my family. I don‚Äôt have time for that to control my mental
So you‚Äôre saying I should bitch about my ancestors whenever someone calls me a name? You realize by allowing that word to have power over you, you‚Äôre just chaining yourself down to history. I‚Äôm not a slave to a word. Prob the most bitch made mentality possible 
@SlayerStarX They don‚Äôt actually care about half the shit they say
Yeah...you guys totally don‚Äôt have some kinda ulterior motive to hate on white people. You know what helps get rid of racial division? More racial division. The irony is lost on you. 
My entire personality isn‚Äôt being black. If comedy is subjective, then so is the people that enjoy it. Only difference between me and you is I don‚Äôt shit my pants when I see a naughty word. Not all black people have to think the same weirdo 
@I_DIDNT_RQ Pronouns are whatever, but the furry shit is always a red flag
@ThankYou_BF One day fam
@I_DIDNT_RQ He‚Äôs acting genuinely Schizo over some YT shit. Like go pet your dog or some shit
He‚Äôs shamelessly promoting in the replies now. Actually pathetic lmfao

@GNT_Jin I‚Äôm swamped. I‚Äôll let u know when I‚Äôm good
@Redacious_ @pebblescrc @StamoSSBM @Paradoxisdumb @sebgoon666 You‚Äôre confusing me with someone that cares
@Redacious_ @pebblescrc @StamoSSBM @Paradoxisdumb @sebgoon666 How arrogant do you have to be to think that you ‚Äúaccepting if it‚Äôs sarcasm‚Äù is relevant at all? Sarcasm is sarcasm. Your input doesn‚Äôt matter
RT @GlinkLive : latest gush episode is up now, we got weird with @OOHKAYEYE  
Going back to my essay now
Don‚Äôt get me mistaken. I am 100% doing all these smash videos because they do the best and they piss most of you off. The fact that more people in your community dislike me makes 0 difference to me. The end result is gonna be the same cuz you all can‚Äôt fucking read apparently.
@Paradoxisdumb @sebgoon666 It‚Äôs called a joke fuckhead. Your entire community doesn‚Äôt matter.
A group of fuckin cry babies
If you‚Äôre trying to argue that a black dude is racist because he thinks your ‚ÄúOnly black people smash server‚Äù is fuckin‚Äô dumb, then good luck with that. As if I didn‚Äôt just say I hate Smash players in general like a week ago. This is part of the reason why
@Redacious_ Pretty much exactly what I said yeah
Sorry lemme rephrase that. ‚ÄúNo one that matters‚Äù. There ya go 
@SlayerStarX They‚Äôll eat whatever I put infront of them. Fuckin sheep
@RipRoshiB They wouldn‚Äôt understand if you explained it for 3 hours
"Wow, you‚Äôre so badass and cool. You totally don‚Äôt sound like a pussy at all man. I apologize please don‚Äôt insult me. 

No one gives a shit about your server "
@RedFoxComms @defnoodles You guys pass Stafoh around like a used condom lmfao

@Sekki_ssb @TheWeepyWeeb I appreciate the offer, but I am genuinely not active in any server and I rly don‚Äôt have the free time to be in new ones

@brett_grisar @GamerInASociety Everybody makes mistakes. Everybody has those days

I think the best take away from the last week is that if we ever see a top player or figurehead wanna ‚Äúpitch in‚Äù on drama, you can just shut them down by linking their own tweet, and that‚Äôs fantastic. Was getting tired of ‚Äúhot takes‚Äù from gamers
@EnnuiKeaton @Teikeji1 I have a sneaking suspicious most of them will shut the fuck up from now on
@Teikeji1 @EnnuiKeaton Uh...idk lemme guess. The part where he admitted to it and apologized?

@MVD731 @fowskate @D_DiscipIe You didn‚Äôt urge them not to at all while also knowing it was happening. That‚Äôs what we call ‚Äúcomplacent‚Äù. If you witness a murder and use this same excuse you‚Äôd be an accomplice cuz it‚Äôs not a real explanation. That makes you part of the problem
@MVD731 @fowskate @D_DiscipIe Yeah whatever
@MVD731 @fowskate @D_DiscipIe That‚Äôs not at all what I did. You‚Äôre not a hero for knowing about and condoning through inaction, underaged drinking. Sorry if I disagree with you being cool with illegal shit
@MVD731 @fowskate @D_DiscipIe You just said that it didn‚Äôt make sense to mention it because the decision was pretty much closed in on, and his shit was done half a year ago...It‚Äôs very weird how you‚Äôre more focused on defending your silence than disavowing the #2 player in your own community.
@MVD731 @fowskate @D_DiscipIe Why is your take that it‚Äôs cancel culture to have verified concrete evidence of guilt? You‚Äôve been spending too much time on Twitter MVD
@MVD731 @fowskate @D_DiscipIe So even tho you openly and actively still engage in conversations on Anti to this day, a single tweet publicly disavowing crime in the scene is asking too much because it won‚Äôt ‚Äúmagically‚Äù do anything? Are you seeing any lack of consistency and integrity there or nah?

RT @fowskate : Real quick just clearing up some confusion that's been going on in Smash Twitter. Here's my take. Hopefully it helps: 
Btw this isn‚Äôt an attack on Cagt. He‚Äôs like the only reasonable person I‚Äôve talked to. It‚Äôs about the discussion people like MVD are trying to create to distract from my existence entirely.
@palebl0od @Cagt3000 Chill out a little. He‚Äôs like the only person acknowledging it
@Cagt3000 Well I appreciate your honesty Cagt. I‚Äôve just seen people who refused to address it and instead make a dig at me for actually helping.
@Cagt3000 I‚Äôm just saying the fact that you didn‚Äôt ban him after Salem‚Äôs response, and the process was somehow perfectly finalized 5-days after the conversation I sparked, is a little annoying to see. As if my involvement was irrelevant
@Cagt3000 You mean besides the screenshot he admitted to in the discussed twitlonger that carries 5yrs in jail? Must be some juicy shit
@Protoscan You‚Äôre assuming this is about money. It‚Äôs a matter of respect and integrity
@Cagt3000 Yeah but like, that‚Äôs really easy to say in hindsight after I put all the pieces together myself. The twitlonger he made starts off with a lie and I don‚Äôt see how it was overlooked.
@Protoscan I don‚Äôt care about what happens to their community. I care about people lying to profit off my work...
I genuinely don‚Äôt understand how all credit is being attributed to TO‚Äôs in this scenario, when Cagt himself stated BEFORE my video came out, that he pushed Sam to make this incorrect twitlonger to bring this to an END and for CLOSURE. Am I just suppose to take being discredited?

I don't think you realize how dumb this would actually make all of your decisions even if it's correct. Instead of banning both Salem/Samsora at the same time, instead you discuss it with Sam and make him post a twitlonger that was CLEARED and was a bold face lie. All public info

I‚Äôm not saying Anti has never done anything questionable. I‚Äôm saying the reactions you all had purely because of the Me 2 atmosphere was 100% reactionary and slanderous. You‚Äôll all be sucking my cock in like a month anyways when I put it into a video. Fucking sheep
@whitejohnlennon Neither is not reading and researching anti‚Äôs position before making blanket assumptions. Guess we both have to make some concessions
@whitejohnlennon Can‚Äôt win an argument with an idiot
@whitejohnlennon The girl involved literally said it wasn‚Äôt rape. Try again
@whitejohnlennon The fact that you‚Äôre asking that means you haven‚Äôt even paid attention to any of Anti‚Äôs responses. Laughable
@whitejohnlennon Again, you‚Äôre reaching really hard on these points yet won‚Äôt take Anti‚Äôs word. That‚Äôs what we call a bias. You‚Äôre not qualified to cover this
@whitejohnlennon Because unlike you I don‚Äôt skim through shit and make rushed statements. You‚Äôll hear about it soon enough
@whitejohnlennon That‚Äôs what we call speculation. You can‚Äôt just say how someone felt about it and that‚Äôs it. Is she a mind-reader? Such a dumb point
Anti making advances on single women is not a crime worthy of this level of ridicule
Thanks for proving you just skimmed everything before making a contrarian post. Don‚Äôt worry, papa Tech is here to fill in the massive illiteracy gap. Speculation is not a conviction  
@whitejohnlennon What you call ‚Äúgetting other people drunk‚Äù I see as a failed advance on a grown woman. In the first twitlonger he even asks if she‚Äôs alright. Massive reach
@whitejohnlennon Yeah, first off I wouldn‚Äôt preface it with a trigger warning on ‚Äúrape‚Äù. You dismiss his defense on supplying alcohol and then just put a blanket title on something entirely unsubstantiated.
There‚Äôs a reason people who don‚Äôt like me are forced to agree with my content. It‚Äôs because I do my research. While it‚Äôs easy to make posts like this with surface level comments, I can 100% GUARANTEE you haven‚Äôt read even half the shit you‚Äôre linking. Stay in your lane

Btw 
Nobody blew up his explanation. Nobody campaigned for his inclusion back into the scene. Some real fucked shit was said, but not a whole lot of apologies. We‚Äôll see about that shit

@Knightish1 It be like that
Seeing people actively spread lies to detract from the discussion, however, rightfully pissed me off.
Regardless of my opinion on Kokiri, I actually really respect this response. My point in the video is not to revive conversation on that, it‚Äôs to point out blatant hypocrisy and inaction with an easily digestible anecdote. I don‚Äôt actually care about changing anything about it 
This chick is stupid. I‚Äôm ordering Postmates 
@zaptiee Because I‚Äôm black
These gossiping mfs are the worst clique in the community. Lacking some serious brain cells here
If I ask you to clear up countless claims with evidence, it seems fair to provide it. Instead you‚Äôd rather make sassy quote RT‚Äôs cuz of your ‚Äúrule on drama‚Äù. Here‚Äôs a rule, how about don‚Äôt start spouting bullshit you heard while gossiping, if you can‚Äôt actually prove any of it.  
@BaelyLive Full of shit
@XanozIchimonji You‚Äôre spreading lies about me and then not backing that up. Your group of gossipers is of little relevance to me. No shit I‚Äôm a dick, but at least I‚Äôm not a cowardice liar
@megallade Nah she spent it on healthcare immediately
@XanozIchimonji How convenient that you can‚Äôt back up how you‚Äôre lying so coincidentally, I can‚Äôt defend myself. If they‚Äôre screenshots about ME, there shouldn‚Äôt be any confidentiality problems. This is just you bullshitting cuz you can‚Äôt back it up now that I‚Äôm asking.
@XanozIchimonji Post the screenshots
@XanozIchimonji For someone that preaches about accountability, you sure as hell seem to be missing any textual evidence to support your lies. Keep feeling like the better person tho
@yaboiplaystand I exposed her for being actually fucking terribly to EVERYONE in the community. Not just men. She turns that around to being the biggest victim because ‚Äúcriticism is harassment‚Äù
And they call ME the liar...
This is just blatant libel at this point. They play the telephone game with information until they find their favorite accusation 
@XanozIchimonji @Sappuration You didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfind out‚Äù my history. One person who I‚Äôve exposed for starting harassment campaigns against others in the community by using her radical politics, told you I was a piece of shit and without a 2nd thought you started bad mouthing me without any research. Pretty shallow
@XanozIchimonji @Sappuration If it‚Äôs weird then get one of your morally correct leaders to do it. Oh wait, they were silent for months and let him off the hook ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. Guess that didn‚Äôt rly work
She really just slipped in ‚Äúharasses minorities‚Äù after calling me a liar. These people are fucking insane lol 
@XanozIchimonji You‚Äôre basically saying you get your opinions from other people which means yours doesn‚Äôt carry much weight. Enjoy making assumptions about things and people you don‚Äôt know I guess?
@XanozIchimonji Am I now required to like every woman that openly talks shit about and defames me? Wtf is this argument? Now you‚Äôre accusing me of just hating all women lol
@XanozIchimonji You‚Äôre literally telling me how I should feel right now. You shouldn‚Äôt apologize if you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. This thought process is not only self-absorbed but deluded.
@XanozIchimonji That‚Äôs you projecting. I‚Äôm doing this purely because I feel like it. I don‚Äôt have to hide anything cuz no one actually cares
@XanozIchimonji I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúfuck up in the past‚Äù. People who dislike me spun a clearly false victim narrative because I annoy them. You putting those two scenarios next to each other and saying ‚Äúyet he wants Samsora blasted‚Äù (who committed a legit crime btw), is actually laughable.
@D_DiscipIe @XanozIchimonji @ReallyRisu I‚Äôm not a smasher. You take that back
@XanozIchimonji Uncomfortable*
@XanozIchimonji I also don‚Äôt think a comedy sketch is the same as potential jail time but hey, you do you
@XanozIchimonji She responded to others before the video, that people telling her they beat off to her content was fine because she knew what kind of content she made. So to turn around and say someone who is obviously joking then makes her feel comfortable when she‚Äôs clearly bias, is bs
My favorite part is how Risu started it lmfao
Why does everyone call it that. I didn‚Äôt just post a vid of me beating it to Kokiri. It‚Äôs a sketch in a video about ESAM. She‚Äôs not even the main topic or a topic at all

@BlorgusKun @RAMBOSS_ This guy‚Äôs a dumbass don‚Äôt waste your time
@RAMBOSS_ There‚Äôs no change in the substance of what I said. You‚Äôre just backpedaling

Ignorant comments and people like this are why a YT comedian needs to handle this shit FOR you. Fuckin hell
Top players consistently and ruthlessly bludgeon others with their fan bases for crumbs compared to this. I fail to see the problem in asking for consistency and transparency from the ones that represent and run the community you‚Äôre in. 
@NotSoImportamt DM me it if you find it
@Mawlerz I pointed out people who called out me obviously like VoiD, Dabuz and Coney, but anyone with significant influence would do. It just seems weird that even Cagt talked to Samsora and didn‚Äôt seem to have a problem with him hiding everything for legal reasons? Like wtf

It seems like Samsora is deleting tweets with my video plugged in his replies and just like with ESAM, the official reddits strike down any links as well. This is the kind of "protect our own" mentality that kept all this shit under wraps for over 3yrs in the first place. Weirdos

The question of ‚Äúwhy‚Äù this is a prediction and how it may correlate to the direct knowledge that Salem had, are not things to be overlooked just because you feel attacked. If you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong then you shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about it this much.
To properly view a case with limited information, the best thing you can do is step back and look at everything as it fits in the grand scope of things. The assumption that I say ‚Äúpedo enabler‚Äù or that that was the purpose, is a reach from my perspective. I‚Äôm building a case.

@Yehss_ I just wanna know if he said the gamer word
@emerald_not Ok I disagree with you then cuz people who do weird stuff around kids should not be major figureheads for children. He 100% shoulda lost his involvement in the community. That‚Äôs just like society 101
@emerald_not Then state clearly what you‚Äôre against because you‚Äôre being incredibly vague for no reason
@InfernoOmni Nice seeing u thrive tho on the real Omni. Enjoy ur shit
@emerald_not Because you don‚Äôt need a court to KNOW if something was wrong. To sit there and do nothing with your dick in your hand is what a dumbass would do. ‚ÄúNo action until the courts!‚Äù He admitted to it. That‚Äôs not a mob coming for him, that‚Äôs the consequences of his own actions.
@InfernoOmni Fuck you. I‚Äôm unlisting the vid
@emerald_not Your initial argument is about legal processes having full control, yet you don‚Äôt know the laws and also don‚Äôt agree that a community of primarily kids is justified in shunning them from the community? Just say you don‚Äôt know wtf is happening instead. It‚Äôd save a lot of time

@_ChickenBear_ I thought I made that clear after I replicated the same mentality with ESAM. Literally did all that with like 10yr old shit
@emerald_not You still there bro? Hello?
Lots of people saying, ‚ÄúPeople grow and learn from their mistakes!‚Äù Wouldn‚Äôt say that shit for like over 80% of the players they kicked out of the community. Suicide is sad, but so is having no moral backbone.
@emerald_not Like telling a 14yr to masturbate with an ice cube?
@stoutpump Yeah the people that go the extra mile to send threats and make life hell is not cool at all. Beyond the overall joking and criticism which is pretty much expected with those types of scenarios
@CoughDropSyrup If I don‚Äôt explicitly state that people will randomly say I supported it so ya know
@elijahJstaton Bitc-
Suicide is never a good choice and I genuinely hope he comes out alright. Hoping that someone‚Äôs ok is a little different from absolving someone of everything they did and wanting them back. Referring to all the people discussing it now. ZeRo still weird and lied until it was over

@itsSirKnight Ya I thought it was fucking dumb regardless. Onions make me cry üò¢
@lul_nul @Viz55168454 Whatever u say dude
@itsSirKnight Apparently that‚Äôs a common myth on counteracting tear gas according to a singular comment I read.
@lul_nul @Viz55168454 Ya sure, if you ignore the fact that the riots were nation wide. That‚Äôs a pretty big straw man to say it was ‚Äújust your local Target‚Äù. Difference is I‚Äôm not making an exception for either
@lul_nul @Viz55168454 Definitely didn‚Äôt sound like that when u were justifying differences in BLM protests where people were killed and buildings burned because one was a civil rights movement. Regardless of motive I disavow that just like the shit at the capital. You gotta be consistent dude
She sounds like Sarah Silverman 
@lul_nul @Viz55168454 Being politically divisive for years on end and being blindly ignorant to it cuz you‚Äôre on a ‚Äúteam‚Äù contributes the most to this shit. Destruction on both sides is bad.
Omg yes! America is saved 
@schmovin I don‚Äôt fuck with people who are annoying. I guess we just disagree
@schmovin Lead with that instead of, ‚Äúthis is a dog shit take‚Äù and maybe I‚Äôd believe u
@schmovin I have words muted so I didn‚Äôt see this response but it‚Äôs still fucking dumb. No one is supporting anyone. Freedom of speech is important and you can‚Äôt just pick and choose which protests are legal and moral when both cause destruction and loss of lives. It‚Äôs not black and white
The way people treat politics like sports fans is annoying. You‚Äôll argue to the death for your team, but you‚Äôre not even a player.
@schmovin You added nothing. Not an opinion bro but thanks
@schmovin Good you had no input after all. Just checking
@PetesLaughin You‚Äôre saying that one is based on lies and that everything BLM stands for is 100% the truth of the world. If that‚Äôs what you believe then cool, but that doesn‚Äôt mean their MOTIVES are different you absolute fucking brainlet. It has 0 to do with your personal beliefs dumbass 
@PetesLaughin Nah, you made an ad hominem attack on my diction because you lack basic vocabulary and then proceeded to miss the point again. The entire point is that both arguments originate from the same place. Just say ‚ÄúFuck Drumpf!‚Äù and go dude.
@PetesLaughin You coulda just googled it instead of admitting you‚Äôre illiterate. 
@PetesLaughin I don‚Äôt think you really understand what‚Äôs being said here. Irregardless if it‚Äôs a lie or not, they‚Äôre both protesting to defend something they believe to be essential for protecting certain freedoms. What part of that origin is different? You just disagree and that‚Äôs fine.
@schmovin Instead of responding like a fucking bot account and adding nothing of value, how about u put it in to words since u have the superior take.
@PunishedEnvoid It‚Äôs an air soft gun
@PetesLaughin Just from the way you describe both positions you‚Äôve already established bias. If u support destruction and loss of lives on the basis of a civil rights movement, then it‚Äôs really not a far reach to at least TRY and understand where your opposition comes from.
@mouglexe I think  did a think piece about it
@PetesLaughin Oh gotcha. So one is different because you disagree with their motive. That just makes you bias. That‚Äôs not really me conflating anything. Everyone believes they‚Äôre the right ones dude.

@GlinkLive You‚Äôre fine. I just try to avoid political tweets so I don‚Äôt accidentally break my ‚Äúfunny guy‚Äù persona ranting about the economy and shit
@AkimSSBM This ad is saying that if you start at the same place, you have an equal outcome. The only way to make it equal is to make sure everyone has the same amount of wealth right? How else would it be equal? Otherwise there‚Äôs still a ruling class with an advantage
@William_Bracamo Equality of opportunity is good. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible or ethical to make sure everyone is wealthy. I think there‚Äôs people who don‚Äôt want to succeed much in life or go far. You can‚Äôt force them to do better either. Free Will is a bitch
@William_Bracamo You‚Äôre just ignorant if you believe you can save every ‚Äúdisadvantaged‚Äù person. If you‚Äôre trying to build a utopia it‚Äôs not gonna work.
@AkimSSBM Explain how to successfully pull everyone to the same tax bracket without starting a civil war.
@scaratlas @William_Bracamo I didn‚Äôt say monopolies were good either. It‚Äôd be a win to introduce regulation for that very reason.
@GlinkLive I blame you for putting this stuff on my timeline 
@William_Bracamo ‚ÄúPutting people on equal playing fields.‚Äù Is impossible on a universal scale. Disparity in wealth is a by product of free will and a free market.
@AkimSSBM You act like that isn‚Äôt worse while you‚Äôre playing the semantics game. ‚ÄúYou must make specific considerations‚Äù, like pulling everyone down to the same economic status. How is that anything but communism
Being treated equally doesn‚Äôt automatically mean you‚Äôll be as successful as anyone else. The government doesn‚Äôt hand you a decent work ethic u fucktards.

@inversedaniel @WillyMacShow I‚Äôd switch to Premiere if I wasn‚Äôt so use to Vegas. Maybe in the future
@inversedaniel @WillyMacShow Vegas has this rare crash where the master volume dials turn blue and it stretches out every layer while slowing down the program. Most aggravating shit cuz when I reopen I have to readjust my layer sizes
@inversedaniel @WillyMacShow Wait...can you change the auto save rate on Vegas Pro 15?
@WillyMacShow It‚Äôs crazy how Premiere is almost just as ass as Vegas with crashing and mine was cracked. Fucking dog shit software

@SlushTV_ Not at all
@WillyMacShow What a chad
Soft 
 
@GlinkLive @SlushTV_ Well also everything we say as commentators gets screenshotted and held against us lol. Jumping the gun, unless you‚Äôre researching or some shit, is never a good choice for optics.
This is how it should be. Feels like I‚Äôm not living in a fucking clown simulation for once. 
@WillyMacShow NOT TOM
@GNT_Jin You didn‚Äôt even get comms banned playing with me wtf lol
@GlinkLive Can‚Äôt wait for Waifu Glink tbh
@SailorrLuna You got a bot in your replies lol
I gained em back lol. Just random people not use to different content 
@TreyEnma I‚Äôll prob edit that and throw it on the new channel cuz it was some good stuff
@TaborTCU Lol
I pissed this drunk dude off in Valorant last night and got him to start ranting about his net worth. Truly embodying noob dog lmao
I think I‚Äôm gonna make another channel just for all the troll stuff after all. I‚Äôll plug it in the next vid. I kinda wanna do streams of just that and see how it goes cuz that‚Äôs the only thing I can see myself enjoying streaming in the meantime.
@NewsM101 Lol I'm depressed in my room leave me alone
I‚Äôm lazy af but ty 
@Xaari123 The screen shots people are arguing about
Oh and the grooming.
I‚Äôm kinda sweatin‚Äô about this Pyro shit ngl. What if he‚Äôs actually a furry? I can‚Äôt support that shit
@TreyEnma It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs a coon by default for attempting to make a difference lol. Working together was never an option
@thenameisSilent This is why I stopped following it. It‚Äôs legitimately bad for you
People get so caught up in politics that it‚Äôs not even about helping people anymore or being correct. It‚Äôs like watching mentally challenged sports fans
The guy*
People were on Kanye‚Äôs dick for ‚Äúplaying‚Äù Trump to get the reform he wanted but when Wayne works with what he has it‚Äôs a problem again. I fail to see how making an effort with the man in charge is an issue. You just gonna ignore the shit until u get they guy u want? Wtf 
@zaptiee Glad you‚Äôre not immediately jumping on the bandwagon despite your deep hatred of British people. Good on you mate
@LordShmeckie Me. I‚Äôm groomers
@WAR_TKay We‚Äôve been through this shit. WAR never changes
Berleezy doesn‚Äôt do shit to no one on this platform besides vibe....are u kidding me? Stop messing with his bread 
Ok that‚Äôs enough Smash hate for one day. If there‚Äôs more substantial follow ups, I might consider bringing the detective in just to make everything more digestible. Drug video should be out in a few days
@WillyMacShow Holy fuck is this guy serious? Lol
"RT @WillyMacShow : You wouldn‚Äôt need to talk about ‚Äúgood faith‚Äù moderation if you just allowed free speech

‚ÄúGood faith‚Äù moderation is completely subjective. "
@yaboiplaystand The irony is lost on them don‚Äôt even try lmfao
Can‚Äôt even form a solid decision without their head organizer having a meltdown on Twitter.
Pretty ironic considering this is coming from a partisan, ill managed group of volunteers that change decisions based on public outcry after hitting ‚Äúsend tweet‚Äù. 
@WillyMacShow Imagine if there‚Äôs was like a decent group of free thinker content creators. Smash probably wouldn‚Äôt be overrun by bots
@Tails_spl Not everyone was his friend that showed up at his house either. There‚Äôs levels to this shit
RT @ahri_EB : @Technicals_ top smash players crying on twitter after prematurely canceling someone for the 4,000,000th time: 
That whole clique of people Wizzy surrounds himself with are so fake. They treasure their 0 tolerance virtue signaling far more than actual friendships. It‚Äôs actually just sad at this point
This whole thread is a pity party and a half. As if he could of possibly been in a darker place than Nairo who he betrayed FRAME 1 while he was getting flooded with death threats. Just take the L
