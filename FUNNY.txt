RT @zaptiee : Had to delete all of my tweets because a copyright troll who has targeted @nicholasdeorio and @AugieRFC is now targeting me. They managed to DMCA takedown a tweet only containing a link to my own podcast. Nick is now suspended. This is beyond fucked.
RT @JohnSwanYT : This is the reason I have always deleted my tweets in the past. I may have to do it more frequently if Twitter does nothing to fix this glaring exploit.
RT @JohnSwanYT : Despite all of this, I'm pretty confident Nick will get his account back because he has some people behind the scenes that can help. But for most others, once you're banned, you're banned forever with no recourse.
RT @JohnSwanYT : @TwitterSupport stays silent on this issue no matter how many times you try and bring it up. There is a serious issue with Twitter's DMCA implementation that I plan to make light of in a video coming soon.
RT @JohnSwanYT : .@nicholasdeorio was just banned on Twitter due to a mass of DMCA takedowns. These takedowns were submitted by an individual that did not own the rights to the content being posted, and has been impersonating companies and other creators for months.

Had he played smart, it wouldn't be worth the troll"
@OOCParks I've gone 24 years of my life without knowing this existed and I can only ask why this existed.

"@HeroScrappy @Technicals_ I agree.

"@HeroScrappy @Technicals_ Everyone is eager to stand up after putting up with shit, and sometimes that's exactly what the troll wants if they know the guy they're fucking with is an idiot &amp; can't stand his ground.

Moral of the story is, trolling shouldn't ever go this far."
"@SlushTV_ @Technicals_ @thekinocorner I don't think he hasn't gotten shit for this, but people can't help but laugh at Frank's dedication to get the worst of Boogie, even if it cost him his life it seems.

There was no winning for Boogie if he stayed gangster either; we'd just have a really cruel tragedy of trolling."
"@Technicals_ Exactly.
Short of Frank getting seriously hurt when putting himself in lethal danger is a moment worthy of a Darwin Award, but fortunately he doesn't get the trophy.
Boogie failing to learn not to play into trolls is exactly what lead to this leaving the internet.
Hard way it is."
"@Technicals_ Let it be known Frank's a POS. Even if he can be funny or shameless, I don't think what he did was right to Boogie; however, Boogie ain't a smart man either.

@ENIAK_Prime @NewsM101 I get that, but at the end of the day, it's for the sake of getting the audio in a loud environment.

"@ENIAK_Prime @NewsM101 I get that, I'm no devil's advocate, I just wasn't sold on either yet and wanted to wait, now I feel a bit more confident in the scenario that it was just a wacky instance of depth perception.

Why would one mic be layered on top of him, only to be brushed over like the other if the other mic layers are overlapped &amp; not rotoscoped?

@Cooltaha3939 nah, it's just spergy teenager speak like you'd see back on Tumblr before 2017.
"I'm skeptical of the clip.

This is legitimately a time for @CDisillusion because I could believe booming up from below to maintain distance, but to boom toward the sky, near an aircraft seems like the worst way to record audio knowing what it'll pick up.

"@NewsM101 That said, I'm not saying I'm not seeing the exact same thing you are.

Shit looks weird like a layer mismatch, but I've done a fair bit of boom techniques &amp; w/ everything being in focus, depth may be deceiving what is really forground.

Tho booming up seems kinda dumb outside 🤔"
"@NewsM101 Realistically it's difficult to pick apart because everything is in focus and to stage a complicated tracking composite would be a lot of work only to fuck up w/ a ""mic"" layer.

@JohnSwanling Admitted is not the same as taking responsibility.
@JohnSwanling When has Keem taken responsibility for doxxing Destiny?
@AnthonyHack17 A copyright strike is a copyright strike, not for taking down videos, even slanderous ones. And what Cobra did (joke about Destiny being a pedo) is pretty shitty but Destiny can absolutely be criticised for going way over the top on a dumb kid to insane levels.
@AnthonyHack17 JD falsely copyright striked a LtCobra video and sent him a fake cease-and-desist letter to intimidate him. He did do stuff wrong. But that doesn't negate anything Keemstar did.
"It seems like this community can't understand when two people who have beef w/each other are both bad.
Keemstar and h3h3 are both bad
Destiny and Keemstar both fucked up in 2019
When these sorts of drama happen, you have people attacking one or attacking the other. Why not both?"

@jadeechonnart Of course I'm okay! I am, mark my words, the most okay person in the entire world, no one has ever been as okay as me. People call me up they say "Donnie, why- how are you so okay?", and I say, I say it's just genes, its called being a winner, because that's what I am, a winner.

"Keemstar folks, Killer Keemstar, a tremendous guy! Everyone says he's the best at reporting the news okay? Real news not fake news like CNN and the radical left. Total fake. Not him, the fake news, the democrats.

@WackyBruhTV @h3h3productions @YouTube I agree its not censorship and I'm not defending him, but I think people should only be punished on-platform for stuff they do on-platform.

@Vampuffin @jadeechonn I'm Australian so idk how they do it in Eastern Europe or wherever you're from. But over here coefficients are treated as separate from normal multiplication.
@TommyNC2010 Tommy you are too good for Ethan, at this point his reputation's so destroyed perhaps associating with him would do more negatives lol. Good for you that you've kept up making content.
@jadeechonn 2(3) is not 2*3. Coefficients are done before divisions, just like squaring.
"@Vampuffin Coefficient is done before the division. So the division is after multiplying the (1+2) by 2.
The coefficient (the first 2) acts as a bracket in a sense. That is how the order of the operations is done.
2*2 is not 2(2)."
"This can be written as 6/(2(1+2)), as the coefficient (the first 2) comes right after brackets in the order of operations and as such can be expressed in that form.
According to the order of operations, brackets come first, so:
6/(2(3))
6/(6)
Then the final division:
6/6 = 1 "

Apparently according to topic commentators, you can't be criticized for clickbait if you get views.
a story in 4 parts... 
@JohnSwanling @DavidplexTalks You didn't exaggerate the title/thumbnail, you just straight up lied lmao
"@JohnSwanling @DavidplexTalks Mr Beast or PewDiePie never said they died in the thumbnail and then in the video their alive.
That's more like Jaystation lol"
"@JohnSwanling @DavidplexTalks Well he didn't die. The title and thumbnail make people click on it because it makes people think he died. Correct?
Then they click on the video and you say he didn't die. That's clickbait."
@JohnSwanling @DavidplexTalks yeah so its clickbait, the title says something different from the video itself to attract more clicks
@_AlexTheLoser_ 💙so proud of you
@JohnSwanling Nope. This generation of people getting offended is the same generation who watched PewDiePie and FilthyFrank. If MrBeast doesn't apologize for edgy jokes from 5 years ago, he won't lose ANY viewers.
@JohnSwanling In 2018 (after demonetization) PewDiePie was pretty edgy still and media hit pieces were made on him all the time and he responded in the best way, by not apologizing for edgy jokes, which is what Mr Beast and other channels now should do.
@JohnSwanling Youtube hasn't demonetized a whole channel for just normal-level "edginess". Crowder and Shane went further than most and those are the only examples I can think of.
"@JohnSwanling Demonetization started being a large issue in 2017, the same year that Filthy Frank left. PewDiePie dropped the edginess in early 2018, Ethan started focusing on the podcast and stopped being edgy in 2018.
People have been edgy way after this."
"@JohnSwanling Twitter and Youtube haven't banned edgy humor (Youtube has banned the REAL edgy stuff tho).
Censorship didn't birth cancel culture, the new generation of youtubers who will bow down to the army of stans did. They normalized blandness."
@JohnSwanling just say 'retard' nigga its not that hard lmao
@JohnSwanling idk about this specific instance, but I think that no one would get cancelled if they didn't try to hide/apologize for edginess
@JohnSwanling Also I was meaning twitter cancelled, so PewDiePie (who was cancelled by the media and Mumkey/Leafy/Crowder (who were kicked by Youtube themselves) don't count. I guess you could make an argument for Shane.
@JohnSwanling If all the youtubers getting 'cancelled' just said "fuck off, I made edgy jokes, deal with it", then the culture of cancelling wouldn't be around.
@JohnSwanling which youtuber's income and life was threatened due to making edgy jokes
"Cancel culture isn't killing comedy.
People giving in to cancel culture is killing comedy."

People like to complain about commentary youtubers. But what exactly makes a good one?
Here are my thoughts, I try and bring up some points that usually aren't discussed.

"@BasedAreZee The biggest problem I had with John is he is too protective over his reputation. He basically got his wish of returning with a second chance, basically no one called him out.
But one sliver of criticism and he couldn't handle it."
gotta say, like them or not @KEEMSTAR, @KavosYT, @YoTommyC @WillyMacShow and @CCrowe90 excel in this department, even if I disagree with them sometimes, I admire their honesty
The most important thing to a commentator in my opinion (apart from their ability to be entertaining) is their courage to stand up for what they believe, no matter how unpopular their opinion is or how much hate they get.
@PogSwan Judging how to live your life off youtubers is a bad idea, but a a good youtuber can be a good role model in aspects. Youtubers are just like anyone else after all, and any good person, regardless of career is someone to look up to.

I find it hilarious that people say that they can only watch his videos if they aren't even paying attention to them lol
unpopular opinion: I genuinely dislike TRO's content and find every video of his incredibly boring
My next video will probably be my last with facecam. Being further away from the microphone produces a slight echo effect (its not that bad, but still noticeable) whereas recording right next to it provides much crisper audio quality.

@smeef_ @DoktorSkippy @Lilmaneyt I made the iceberg, announced the video on twitter and politely asked skipper to just delay the video a bit. I don't think that's unreasonable.
@smeef_ @DoktorSkippy @Lilmaneyt I posted it on the subreddit because I'm a fan of the subreddit and thought people would enjoy it.
@BrizanOnYoutube @DoktorSkippy @Lilmaneyt Because I'm a fan of that subreddit and I posted it for... get this, people to enjoy.
@BrizanOnYoutube @DoktorSkippy @Lilmaneyt I posted it because I thought people would like to see it. I said on Twitter I was making a video.
@KrzearYT Maybe it was a mistake for me to do that, but whoever stealing the idea can still be criticized as well.
@DoktorSkippy I wasn't leaving out DMs on purpose to try and hide stuff lol, they just didn't really add anything that was important that I felt the need to post.
@DoktorSkippy @Lilmaneyt Maybe instead of vaguely saying nothing in DMs, you could commit to your "nice guy" persona and hold off on the vid like I asked. I still think it was a dick move.
@DoktorSkippy @Lilmaneyt I don't there's a point in "crediting me" if I asked you to delay the video and you didn't🤷. Anyway, obviously you, having a channel 20x mine making a video on the exact same chart I made, will stunt the views of my video.
@Ursakastann Exact same
@Arlus He hadn't done much on the video yet, I told him as soon as I found out he was making the video and I asked specifically to delay the video based around my iceberg chart until my video was out
@Arlus I announced I was making a video on it on my twitter, and even if he didn't see it, weeks ago I asked him politely to just delay the video a while, which he vaguely seemed to accept.
@VleasoTV @TheTurnz_ I also posted it to twitter earlier announcing I was making a video on it.
@TheTurnz_ I made the actual original iceberg chart myself and I made it clear in DMs weeks ago that I was putting a lot of effort into it and I would appreciate it if he delayed his vid a bit.
@TheTurnz_ I literally made the iceberg chart his entire video is based off. I think I have some rights here, I didn't just "claim" the topic.
@BrizanOnYoutube I said on Twitter that I would be making a video on it. Weeks ago I asked him if he could delay it until after mine and he said "my bad".
@gayplant101 He's known for weeks. He said "my bad".
@Distronical I made the original iceberg chart and as he has a much bigger channel, it would overshadow any video I would make on the same subject, stunting the video's views.
@Adog00YouTube He's known for weeks now since I told him in DMs.
@radmaniiac I told him in DMs weeks ago.
I told him a week ago to just delay the video until after my one (which I announced earlier and made the original iceberg chart on reddit) since he has a larger channel and the video would overshadow mine, and he said "my bad". Then why is he still uploading it now???

@acidmais @Bean_Machine420 @JustKyya Just because "that's how it is", it doesn't mean it's a good thing.
@acidmais @Bean_Machine420 @JustKyya I can say it and I will, I genuinely dislike people who are in it just for the money/views. If you make money/views while making content you believe is good quality, that's great! But people whose main goal is as much money/views as possible are shit.
"@Bean_Machine420 @acidmais @JustKyya ""Making good content is too hard so I'll just do what gets me views/money""

if you care about subs more than making genuinely good content, eat shit, you don't deserve any audience"
@Bean_Machine420 @acidmais @JustKyya It's not all about the views and subscribers, otherwise make toy elsa unboxing videos, it'll get even more views than any commentary could.
@acidmais @JustKyya Yes, editing is overrated anyway, personality is everything
@acidmais @JustKyya I agree, I think people who get upset at anyone who makes Vegan Teacher/Pokimane/Dream videos are stupid because some are genuinely entertaining.
@acidmais @JustKyya I'm not saying you are one of those people, but all I'm saying is if a creator knowingly makes bad content just because it gets them views, they don't deserve respect.
@acidmais @JustKyya Although I do find many topic commentators to not be entertaining at all (rather using trend hopping for success), I do agree that it is one of the fastest ways to grow. However any creators that take that path shouldn't expect respect when they blatantly take that path.
"@acidmais @JustKyya People have tried new things and if its an interesting, original idea, it works. It's not like anything apart from a Dream/Vegan Teacher video is destined to fail.
Also, not everything's about how to get the most subs."

@StellaVindicta @VleasoTV @AidinTLC @RadManiac @arztalks @TheTurnz_ @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @GeneralHayley @imallexxstan69 SO MANY people did.

@TheTurnz_ @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @GeneralHayley @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 What I meant was everyone thought she was 13 even though she was 12.

@StellaVindicta Multiple of us blocked her after she said that, (because we realized we had been talking weirdly with a 12-year-old) so she left almost immediately.
@StellaVindicta @JadaTheDemon @realExate @hannah_animal @zoggyt I realized its wrong though, I even said in that DM that I felt disgusted by those conversations. I said multiple times this stuff would never happen again.
@StellaVindicta It didn't. All the joke flirts were in the group DM ( you can ask the people in the group DM how they were)
@StellaVindicta Flirting was in group DMs as well as public tweets

@zoggyt @CordWit @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I AM NOT A PEDOPHILE
@zoggyt @StellaVindicta @CordWit @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @imallexxstan69 It was one stupid mistake and it will never happen again. I deserve another chance.
@zoggyt @CordWit @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I don't even know if I was aroused by that. And even if I was why should I deactivate over something where if I was, I would have no control over.
@StellaVindicta @zoggyt @CordWit @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @imallexxstan69 There is no way I am ever leaving the internet.
RT @2gay2lift : Everyone's out here using wojak memes as if they're not just rage comics again
@zoggyt @CordWit @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 You haven't explained why I should deactivate. That stuff will never happen again.
"@zoggyt @CordWit @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I honestly don't know, I don't know what I meant then but I am certainly not attracted to her.
In fact I blocked her right after that DM and said that I was disgusted by that stuff."
RT @Sub2Michae1 : @nicholasdeorio thanks for some of the criticism on my thumbnails and a bit of my content. appreciate it!
@zoggyt @CordWit @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 Wait for my full response, as people commonly say with accusations like these, and I will explain everything.

@Dino__lol I know I'm in C lmao.
@zoggyt @CordWit @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 No, not a type. But I didn't mean what I said.
@zoggyt @CordWit @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I don't see why I need to leave the community over an off-hand comment that I didn't even mean
@zoggyt @CordWit @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 Wait for my full response before jumping to conclusions

@dumpylol FORTNITE FISH FORTNITE FISH
@CordWit @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I agree. I was wrong and I need to reevaluate myself. I don't disagree with the people saying what I did was weird and fucked up. I just think I deserve a second chance.
@CordWit @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I agree sort of. I fully take responsibility and I was wrong. Although I don't think I deserver to get kicked out of the community It will never happen again after all.
@CordWit @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I wasn't in my right mind
@JohnSwanYT @_Davidplex @Neoncaffeine @GeneralHayley @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 It is fucking weird I know. And it will never happen again. Why should I leave the internet???
@JohnSwanYT @dominosPZAZ5 @Neoncaffeine @GeneralHayley @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I do not remember EVER hearing her real age. There are even tweets (her account is now deleted) of her saying she is 13
@JadynIsBanned I did
@JohnSwanYT @_Davidplex @Neoncaffeine @GeneralHayley @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 You heavily insinuated it.
@Sub2Michae1 @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @GeneralHayley @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I'm not a pedo and I stand by that. I will tell the whole story tomorrow in a docs/twitlonger.
@Neoncaffeine No one knew she was 12
@JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @GeneralHayley @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 She said she was 13.
"@StellaVindicta Yes, I lied but I'm telling the whole truth now. I do NOT find 12-year-olds attractive, I said something dumb that I didn't mean.
Like I said, I will respond in full tomorrow"
@Neoncaffeine @JohnSwanYT @GeneralHayley @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 No one knew she was 12 and when they did everyone (including me) blocked her.
@JohnSwanYT @GeneralHayley @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 Half the small commentary community was flirting with her.
@StellaVindicta @JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @AidinTLC @imallexxstan69 I know, I never said I didn't. But I am NOT a pedophile.
@Neoncaffeine @JohnSwanYT @StellaVindicta @AidinTLC @imallexxstan69 I agree, it is weird. But not pedo.
@JohnSwanYT @StellaVindicta @Neoncaffeine @AidinTLC @imallexxstan69 You're right. I fucked up. Big time.
@Neoncaffeine @JohnSwanYT @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 No, I said I was disgusted and turned on at the same time.
@JohnSwanYT @StellaVindicta @Neoncaffeine @AidinTLC @imallexxstan69 Yes, 13 isn't that bad for me, i'm 15.
@Neoncaffeine Wrong. I didn't try to get with her. I blocked her after the DM.
@JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I didn't mean what I said. I'm not attracted to kids. Once I found out her age I told her I'm disgusted that I flirted with her before and I blocked her. You can dm her to confirm it if you want
@Neoncaffeine @JohnSwanYT @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I'm not. I didn't mean what I said.
@StellaVindicta @Neoncaffeine @AidinTLC @JohnSwanYT @imallexxstan69 Yes but I didn't know her age before. He did.
@JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 Shouldn't people get second chances?
@Neoncaffeine @JohnSwanYT @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 No, I don't know why I said it but I promise I am not into kids
@StellaVindicta @Neoncaffeine @AidinTLC @JohnSwanYT @imallexxstan69 
@JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 IDK I was probably just saying some stupid shit. My bad.
@Neoncaffeine @JohnSwanYT @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I didn't mean that
@StellaVindicta @Neoncaffeine @AidinTLC @JohnSwanYT @imallexxstan69 Then he's lying, I didn't know her age before then. It's in he fucking group chat
@JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I didn't mean what I said. I'm not turned on by children.
@StellaVindicta @Neoncaffeine @AidinTLC @JohnSwanYT @imallexxstan69 ???? I didn't. DM me that proof. I had NO idea.
@JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 How can I control that??? The best thing I could have doen in the situation was block her and that's what I did.
@Neoncaffeine @JohnSwanYT @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I never said I want to get with a 12 year old
@JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 Well no but it was an accident for me to tell her that.
@Neoncaffeine @JohnSwanYT @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 Yeah that was wrong and I shouldn't have said that. However immediately after sending that DM I blocked her.
@JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 That was an accident, yes it's wrong but I see no reason to leave the community. I blocked her immediately after this and I won't do anymore of this sort of shit again.
@Neoncaffeine @JohnSwanYT @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 Like I said I had no idea she was 12
@JohnSwanYT @Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I didn't know she was 12 before this. Once I found out I DMd her that and said we would not talk anymore and I blocked her.
@Neoncaffeine @StellaVindicta @imallexxstan69 I didn't know she was 12 lol. She flirted with half of the commentary community (including people over 18).

@ZoidxFox @defnoodles I'm not blocked and I don't know why
@DiscHighway Image perms aren't aloud for non-youtubers (apart from in #pics and #memes) because the server was raided
How am I still not blocked by @defnoodles? I've tried pretty hard to get that badge of honor
"@TheTwoon 
This video by Kurzgesagt explains it very well and is very interesting."
@AidinTLC Yeah he literally did it because I didn't let him have image perms because he posted gore porn in the server.
Gonna leave this drama behind me. Focusing on making my video now.

@imallexxstan69 what's so yikes? It's not in a sexual way or anything lol
@imallexxstan69 Yes, its just cute watching my friends' videos from when they were 10 and 11.
@Twizz_Fizz cursed
Honestly, I love watching my friends' commentary videos from like 2 years ago and listening to their cute high-pitched voices. It's so cute.
"I know quite a lot of people have been asking to be in my next video, but sorry the next video is going to be a pretty small video so not really a collab.
The only person involved will be @ZoidxFox to edit it."
@AidinTLC eh I'm not the biggest fan of TRO but yeah the others are incredible
@imallexxstan69 Maybe you should make some friends instead of weirding everyone out all the time.
@OhMarDayz BWC is Aussie. James Marriott and WillNE make shit content.

@Krazzf women are pregnant
@Krazzf Yeah, I'm a WAP (West Anglican Protestant)
@The_Coom_Slayer I hate bad characters, male or female. These are bad characters.
@ilymais I don't even know which type of people this post is meant for...
Woo yeah baby! That's what I've been waiting for
@MrMicrowave_exe video
*1.3k
thanks for the 1.3 views my guys! 
@VleasoTV Michae1 checked (soon after it was uploaded though) and the same results came up so idk
@BillBaines_ @JohnSwanYT This is why John Swan wants to keep Section 230
i don't really understand but i agree 
Now I have a reason to go on the commentary tier lists
While I am happy to see the positive reaction to my video, I am incredibly grateful to all the people who have criticized the video, especially some larger commentators. It is impossible to improve without recognizing your mistakes or where you can do better after all.
RT @actuallyQwack : @_ThePieman_ 
@Distronical I'm not making any more videos similar to this one
@Bowblax @XanderhalTV We got far-left, centre-left, centre-right, we just need a far-right person to be the 4th host.
@Distronical you'll have to wait and see
@inversedaniel @AugieRFC I think Augie is too careful to be considered a rapist, even by Xanderhal. He makes sure to keep at least 10 meters away from women at all times.
If my video gets 10k views, I will tweet the URLs of all the cringy meme videos I made years back.
@DrChris_PhD That really cleared things up. Thank you, Twitter!
@Database1337 Yeah, I don't expect most people to watch the whole video lol. And thanks, your words mean a lot.
@aid8nn To get to 100 likes quicker to post the tweet.
@Database1337 No, you seriously make banger videos. I always stop whatever I'm doing to watch your video whenever you upload.
@Database1337 But you make videos with the quality of a 100k sub commentator
ok this is epic 
@Rainyoffline Some commentators just got out of primary school.
@StellaVindicta True, but 4th for Colossal Is Crazy is just strange (or crazy). After looking at analytics an unusually large portion of the views is coming from search so the video must do extremely well in search.
This is REAL lmao
@WhalezYT I don't know what a 12-year-old (guessing from the picture) can expect to happen if he decides to e-dte.
"Wow, on incognito my video comes up 4th for 'LtCorbis', 5th for 'Soph' and 5th for fucking 'Colossal Is Crazy'.
My video is either doing really well in search results or my incognito mode is broken (possibly the latter lol). "
@Saucy__Jack I think Pieman has been on a downward spiral mentally and now he's lost it completely
6 away from not being a 100 sub commentator anymore 
@gamertrash14 not too long, couple weeks tops
Now I am officially a youtuber
@AidinTLC lol I was at 147 subs 8 hours ago
lol i'm getting all these discord friend requests from random people. My discord DMs are open, but I only friend actual friends on discord.
@imallexxstan69 How old is Zoid again?
@Saucy__Jack I'm not sure about that but I sure hope so!
@Saucy__Jack Thanks! While the editing (both visual and audio) is not the best, I am genuinely proud of the writing and research put into the video. Glad you liked it.
For anyone wanting the list of music used in my latest video: 
@ZoidxFox @darthfader27 what happened?
"I actually came close to interviewing @sewernugget for my video but she declined at the last minute. Anytime she or Victor wants to agree to an interview, I’m down.
Also, I would love to see her do a live reaction to the full thing."
Slightly edited title to add [LtCorbis] so people searching for 'LtCorbis' will come up with my video because that is very specific to her whereas 'Soph' reveals a bunch of other channels and stuff unrelated.
"@AspergersFox The video is a homage.
And no there is literally no better channel than his."
I'm glad YouTube removed over 20 dislikes from my video, maybe the dislikes were an error or some sort of raid but thanks @TeamYouTube
RT @NewsM101 : Nightmare fuel of a thumbnail. 
500 views in 3 hours. Nice! 
obviously a joke btw, go give him a follow

@KatszeH I disagree, I really like the music choices and I used some different ones he didn't use
Lol obviously the video is very similar to EmpLemon. It's a homage, just like what JustJargon did with Down The Rabbit Hole.
@OGEPIC1 homage!

@CordWit I think since so many were supporting Pyro and he was going to be believed no matter what he got a bit lazy. Whereas with most people an allegation like this could destroy their career, Pyro's was at no harm. At least this is what I get out of it.

RT @belchovskib : @owenbroadcast Baste and breadfilled
@dominosPZAZ5 @arztalks Because the hosts are pretty small channels.
@dominosPZAZ5 @arztalks Sorry I was wrong about the sub-level. But they only had 37 episodes (not counting reunions) and my point stands anyway, that 100 subs are not that much and you don't need Baited-level entertainment for it.
RT @jordylancaster : “i usually like your tweets, but you posted one opinion that i disagree with. unfollowed.” 
@dominosPZAZ5 @arztalks lol Baited had like 30 episodes and a million subs, I don't think you need to be as entertaining as them to have 100 subs
@CNN @angeladewan Next time do a little research. Erdogan isn't a "populist", he is just a right-wing dictator. I understand that right-wing populists usually have a degree of authoritarianism but connecting Erdogan as a populist is dishonest.

RT @TheTurnz_ : Some people can’t take a joke. I’m done looking stupid by arguing with sensitive idiots, which of course was dumb on my part. All in all, if you’re going to be a commentator: learn to take a joke. If you joke about others, prepare to be joked about in response.

@Sub2Michae1 
@MrBTFO @KEEMSTAR The evidence of doxxing and swatting and spamming streamers with CP is ALL out of context. ALL the streamers and youtubers who attested to it lied? I severely doubt that. You know the truth.
@MrBTFO @KEEMSTAR What would be their motive? After all, there is piles of evidence but even if hypothetically they were to have faked it, why would they go through so much effort to do it?
@MrBTFO @KEEMSTAR For all the other things that you did. You know what I mean.
@OGEPIC1 @TheTurnz_ Nah, writing the script is the best part. Recording is also fun but editing just takes so long and is so boring.

I didnt really do anything that wrong or to attack/hurt people, however I have noticed that (to no intention of the big commentators making their tweets) I am being treated more harshly and less jokingly than I believe I deserve. Again, make fun of me. But I deserve some respect.
Look, I'm fine with, in fact I even enjoy being made fun of and teased and I have no problem with people unfollowing me. But having some cringe tweets and being awkward around women does not mean I should be treated as a pariah on the levels of Raintism or Shive.
"@loafyxo Look, I don't want to converse with you anymore because you threw around the most insane accusations towards me, and anyone who looks through the conversation we had can see it. Now you are changing the conversation.

Anyone who sees this tweet, please read our ""debate"" we had."
@loafyxo Also, you are literally insane. You accused me of using my fanbase to harass you and John Swan and that I am being an abuser who lies and gaslights.
@loafyxo I do have a pretty small amount of followers, especially compared to John Swan.

@AllucidLol @TheTurnz_ @DaceptYT @rythril I hate half the people there lol. I didn't decide who joins the call.
@TheTurnz_ @AllucidLol @DaceptYT @rythril Allucid was wrong to assume for no reason that Turnz liked Raintism, but I think what he was trying to say is that he would prefer to keep that e-dating stuff private now. Bringin up something he would like private is different from making fun of a close friend.
@AllucidLol @TheTurnz_ @DaceptYT @rythril Turnz isn't even friends with that weirdo Raintism
@beatmastermatt At least this one is real.... right? 
"@TPuppetOG @JohnSwanYT @EmperorLemon You clearly miss the point of everything I say and are going in circles so I think I'll leave it here.
Thank you for your time and I hope I cleared up some misconceptions :)"
Why is @Sub2Michae1 in here 
"@TPuppetOG @JohnSwanYT @EmperorLemon I was the subject of your 'critique' and as such I have a right to defend myself against such baseless accusations, it is not harassment.
And as I said before, John quote tweeted me and you don't seem to have a problem with that?"
"@TPuppetOG @JohnSwanYT @EmperorLemon I am saying that John Swan quoted me and you don't seem to have a problem with that.
I didn't go 'out of my way' to harass you, I replied to a few comments and I replied to you to clear up what I thought was a misunderstanding.

Who's screeching now?"
@TPuppetOG Oh my, heavens I'm so scared
@TPuppetOG What in that exact tweet is incorrect? You said I was using 'pointless emojis', which is not true, sure you may disagree with the usage of them but they are not 'pointless'.
@TPuppetOG @JohnSwanYT @EmperorLemon Quote tweeting is a part of twitter. John Swan quote tweeted me. Also, I don't think I made any snide remarks.
Apparently, me and my 300 followers are harassing you and John Swan, who has over 20 thousand followers. Also practically no one has even liked, tweeted about or replied to this conversation so I don't see any harassment. 
"@TPuppetOG @JohnSwanYT @EmperorLemon on me aren't really things I can respond to such as my tweets being unfunny or cringe (subjective things).
Also, I don't think I am screeching or such given as I have been much more polite in this discussion and unlike you have not resorted to personal attacks once.
(2/2)"
"@TPuppetOG @JohnSwanYT @EmperorLemon Humor is subjective after all, but I thought the funny part was the referencing of it, as in like memes reference things and the reference itself is the joke.
I am clearly taking criticism, I am responding to most points about me after all, and most tweets clowning (1/2)"
@C0nT3nTl3af yes, tomorrow
"@TPuppetOG This point?
"
"@TPuppetOG Oh and also you haven't even tried to defend your original tweet which was completely incorrect, rather diverting topics.
"
@TPuppetOG @JohnSwanYT @EmperorLemon Here's Cambridge's definition of a parody. Something can surely be both a parody and homage. 
@TPuppetOG Your original 'analysis' was that I used 'pointless emojis' and that I was like a '12 year old who just learned how to make ASCII dicks'. I don't see how any of our further discussion proved your point or in fact had anything relating to it.
@TPuppetOG I can, however, I don't go browsing through someone's bio before deciding to reply to them on twitter.
@TPuppetOG @JohnSwanYT @EmperorLemon How am I a "psuedo-intellectual"? I was not being unoriginal by copying him, I was paying homage to him as I clearly see him as a large influence on my style of content. Also how am I immature again? What, I made some unfunny or cringe tweets, so what? Everyone has before!
@Sub2Michae1 @LtCythix May 9, how long ago was that again? 
@Timelog123 @aid8nn It clearly says 65
@Sub2Michae1 @aid8nn did he really lol?
Also, he can't make the argument that 'any emojis are bad' because he also has some in his handle also happening to reference a channel, although in an even less obvious way
'pointless emojis'  
@TPuppetOG @JohnSwanYT @EmperorLemon What makes you think that? Anyways your original tweet that was supposed to "destroy" me has been debunked so this is obviously you changing the discussion point.
@em_dee_ess @JohnSwanYT unironically thanks for the criticism, my tweet was just me practising my swan impression, wasn't meant to be 'funny' or anything. I will follow your advice :)
@NJtrashboys @JohnSwanYT ???
@inversedaniel @JohnSwanYT @tommycsftp get on this
@TPuppetOG @JohnSwanYT If you couldn't tell the 'emojis' are parodying popular commentary YouTuber @EmperorLemon's Twitter handle.
@jadeechonn My impression of him.
@jadeechonn It wasn't supposed to be 'funny' though that's the point I'm trying to make.
@Dino__lol @LtCythix @JohnSwanYT And also the fact that he is much better than me
@jadeechonn Exactly, and if you looked at my tweet for more than a second you could tell it wasn't some attack at Swan as many assume but me doing an impression of him as I like doing impressions of commentators.
"@jadeechonn @JohnSwanYT 
You don't need it second-hand when you can have it first-hand"

@JohnSwanYT Sure lol I was just trying my impression out but follow or unfollow whoever you want

"@BdankYT @Krazzf He's probably gonna do some shit like ""thank you all so much, make sure to subscribe to my channel"".

He should say something like ""This is Krazzf's mom, you people are bullying my son and I will call the police🚔 unless you stop"""
@OGEPIC1 Not just that, small commentators are mentioned, tweeted about and doing collabs with some of the biggest commentators.
@BdankYT @Krazzf yes, even though from now on he can't use it 2-3-4 in the morning
There is no other community on YouTube that has this much connection between creators this small and large, none at all, which is part of what makes this community great. 
@imallexxstan69 ? what is a spaz
This is a good thing btw, this allows for small commentators to grow much easier than in previous years and fosters (mostly) growth among commentators big and small.
Even if it is mostly negative, 2020 has revolutionized the commentary community in a way that small 500 sub commentators like Krazzf get talked about by the biggest commentators like Keemstar. Commentary has truly become ONE community.
"To be serious, my friend and co-host @TheTurnz_ is one of the best and nicest people I've met. I've never encountered a situation since I first got to know him where he made a wrong decision or was unkind

@KyleKulinski i agree
RT @_ThePieman_ : Gonna try to get @Krazzf on the Drama Time podcast this weekend
@munke97244693 I'm saying why can they do it and not me?
@BdankYT @Krazzf I mean you're basically part of the "Drama Time Crew" or whatever, people who always are put on, like how Augie always has a few people who go on every stream.
@munke97244693 Large commentators speak of small commentators way worse than I do.
@munke97244693 I'm not acting like I'm better than them, I'm criticizing how cringy their content is. And if everyone is cringy in some way, who can do that then?
@munke97244693 Everyone is cringe in a different way. Just most aren't honest about revealing it.
@munke97244693 Yeah its a bit cringe but it's a question I was asked and I answered honestly. I still think its nowhere as cringe as some other commentator's content. Also I can make fun of them while being a bit cringe myself, everyone as something cringe about them.
Gonna try to get @Krazzf on the Drama Time podcast this weekend
@munke97244693 So I'm very awkward around girls. Why are so many people angry about me for it? People saying how I'm just a cringe commentator now and that I've "fallen from grace". Yeah it's kinda cringe but it's not very unusual for a teenager.
Why am I even on these lists? I have no videos and somehow I get a B. At least put me in 'F' for my upload schedule and cringy tweets. 
@DeadMemeFrog @zoggyt @AllucidLol @Adog00YT @YouTube_BriZ At least when I go on your podcast it'll be interesting
@munke97244693 I stand by my tweet. I don't think they are "shit takes" despite popular consensus.
@zoggyt @AllucidLol @Adog00YT @YouTube_BriZ How do I act like a small commentator? I very, very rarely start drama or "expose" people, yes I make cringe takes but everyone does even big commentators and I try not to get involved in unnecessary beef as small commentators so often do.
@AllucidLol @Adog00YT @YouTube_BriZ Part of it looks 360p because the source material was 360p. And like I said not just Leafy but some other big commentators too.
not changing profile picture for christmas
"@AllucidLol @Adog00YT @YouTube_BriZ No, I never said it does. However, I certainly have talked to quite a few big commentators before and I have connections. Also, I am very well known in the medium commentary community.
Besides, anyone can judge small commentators, even other small commentators."
@AllucidLol @Adog00YT @YouTube_BriZ I can show you the DMs lol
@AllucidLol @Adog00YT @YouTube_BriZ A video called "leafy clones", there are reuploads on youtube. Part of the video was based on my commentary chart I made and Leafy followed me to ask me to make a blank template for it.
@AllucidLol @Adog00YT @YouTube_BriZ Before he got terminated obviously.
@AllucidLol @Adog00YT @YouTube_BriZ I barely mention it! And he followed me because I helped him with a video.
@Vampuffin Would you like me to DM you the unlisted 2 hour long video which will be uploaded soon?
Send me the WORST commentary videos on the internet for me to react to.
@DaceptYT A lot of relevance within the community as well as common communication with much larger channels. I would consider people like @CordWit and @Database1337 large commentators despite their relatively low sub counts.
voter fraud 
@Adog00YT @DaceptYT yes that could count
@DaceptYT You can have under 10k subs and be not be a 'small commentator' but you have to have less than 10k subs to be a 'small commentator'.
my second video will be a commentary talking about and reacting to bad small commentators

@KeatonWalshYT i agree
@Rainyoffline Says the person who faked many heart attacks
@YouTube_BriZ I do
@BdankYT @YouTube_BriZ me too
@YouTube_BriZ being a big (20k subs) commentator doesn't get you anywhere in life either.
@YouTube_BriZ Like I said I don't think subscriber counts have to do with the definition of "big YouTuber", I think it has more to do with the connections you have in the community.

I'm glad I'm not really in the "small commentary community", everyone in there is getting allegations and getting cancelled every day. 
Exactly 
small commentators are 100% cringe
@Saganax most people in that call are younger than 16 so yeah probably

@LmmSkits I can, happily. Only if you follow up on your promise first

@LmmSkits Do it.
Gonna be honest here, this sort of attention, money and fame is not healthy for a 16 year old.

@Stafoh do you really need a keyboard? seems like a waste of space
I have taken Pieman's laptop away for being too cringe. Pieman will be getting his laptop back in 2 seconds and yes as his girlfriend that definitely exists I will be watching his account

I very rarely unfollow people. In fact I don't think I've ever unfollowed anyone.
@iamchiefyt ALOT of people got mad. I mean maybe it was a bad take but the reaction was way beyond anything I expected. 
commentary videos about rappers are just as cringe as commentary videos about roblox

@MelTheCuteKitty twitter is about people sharing opinions if you don't know
@zoggyt I guess I can see where he's coming from. I don't really care if people unfollow me anyway.
lol if you have acne you deserve to get bullied lmao 
I thrive on drama. Youtubers unfollowing me only makes me stronger. I'm not a weakling who will cave into his influencer overlords for clout, afraid of saying what's on their mind in fear of getting cancelled by the same people who claim to despise it.

@lottasin nice
I would love a free-speech alternative to Twitter, but every time it seems like one pops up it turns out to just be the opposite of Twitter, banning anyone left-of-center and allowing and promoting any right-wing content. I just want an unbiased site where no one is banned.

@ilymais Maybe, but I'd put the estimate at &lt;1% of 15yo girls who wear makeup do it as a "creative outlet".
 
@ilymais How is putting some stuff on your face that makes you look different "expressing yourself"?
@ilymais I don't think the majority of them are using it to "express themselves". Most are using it to "make them look better" (which is a horrible mindset that has repercussions) or to attract attention from boys.
@ilymais Yes, they generally do, however they are not mentally mature for it and it generally has a negative effect on their mental health. The same goes for 15-year-olds.
@ilymais Should 5 year olds wear makeup?
The only sane answer. As in Family Guy and Rick and Morty. Unless you could separate seasons, then I would get rid of post-2000 Simpsons, but if not the classic episodes are too good to get rid of. 
@lottasin Too young
@StellaVindicta No lol. I'm a boy why would I wear makeup
@NotChrisPool I know, I'm just mentioning what the post said. While the majority of voters vote based on party lines (R and D), I think both Republicans and Democrats actually agree with their party's platform.
@BasedSerbian @Vampuffin @Bowblax bad take
"@BasedSerbian @Vampuffin @Bowblax I don't disagree necessarily. Either way,

@Vampuffin @Bowblax what's wrong with geography &gt;:(
@imallexxstan69 would you say the same to 5 year olds? 15 year olds are not mature enough to have makeup
@imallexxstan69 disagree. 5 year olds and 15 year olds are more similar in mental capacity than 15 year olds and 25 year olds
@imallexxstan69 do you think 5 year olds should wear makeup?
"@imallexxstan69 makeup does not help with self-confidence it only makes them think they look bad.
Express yourself in a different way then, 15 is too young for that stuff"
@NotChrisPool Look, I don't like the democrats, but what if the democrats want higher taxes and no guns because of actual reasons, even if you disagree with them.
@imallexxstan69 wrong
If you are 15, there's no reason for you to have or wear makeup.

one day I would love to see an actually good comedy based on the Trump presidency. It would be gold.

@MepotismYT nope
@MepotismYT its broken
@iamchiefyt I've tried so many times exporting though and the one time where it worked was the time it had that on it.
look. My video has "Needs GPU Acceleration" on it for like 3 seconds. I am keeping it in the video because I can't be bothered to re-export it. I will clarify this in a pinned comment.

@Krazzf @neoforests what is wrong with this community
@Krazzf 
I know for a fact most big youtubers who follow me have me on mute
I was in a Leafy video on his actual youtube channel before he was banned. That is an honor I will wear my entire life and most other people will never get a chance to.

@RikkaIsMyGF that was a bit too horny

@RikkaIsMyGF Coen Bros are much better
@RealSuko_YT turnzy burnzies
@RikkaIsMyGF overrated
@VleasoTV 
Mark my words: I am never quitting commentary
Honestly, this sort of thing is immature and naive. Dropouts are very likely to do much worse than non-dropouts and even if you become successful on youtube (which is not guaranteed), youtube is usually not a stable income until you have millions of subs or have successful merch. 
@Stormblessings1 @KEEMSTAR @WillyMacShow @XanderhalTV I disagree

@MevieMeve @nicholasdeorio Not really comparing you to them. Although I don't think you should have mentioned Keem's daughter at all, she didn't do anything and doesn't deserve this sort of discussion on social media at this age.
@BillBaines_ @RealBWC @nicholasdeorio @ImAllexx You sound a lot like him lol. Good impression!
@MevieMeve @nicholasdeorio Not specifically talking about you. Just saying whenever Keem posts a picture of him with his daughter, there's people saying how they would love to fuck her or that they're sure that Keem rapes her, stuff like that.
@nicholasdeorio Yeah, I always see disgusting people talking about Keem's daughter in weird ways in his replies.
@AstraJobriath @BrittanyVenti 
@KEEMSTAR @WillyMacShow @XanderhalTV Keem they want you de-platformed that's why. He has said before that you should be banned off Youtube. They are pro-censorship.

@CordPriv Perhaps there could be some function relating to redstone, like a copper wire which works in the same way an ever-suggested "bluestone" would work, redstone but not connecting to redstone.
@XanderhalTV He wasn't a rapist, wasn't that debunked?
@smartayylmao At this point they're safe Biden, unless recount shenanigans give Trump the lead in WI, both have basically counted all their votes and have a pretty large Biden lead.
"97% chance Trump wins North Carolina
80% chance Trump wins Georgia
55% chance Trump wins Pennsylvania

@quetzalcoatI_ @zoggyt 
@zoggyt It's the stupidest thing honestly, arguing about a hypothetical election between youtubers lol
@zoggyt I agree, I calculated that in, especially for the southern states. However white women suburbanites ("karens") aren't as much of a voter base in the Midwest, where Keemstar has a lot of support in working class men.
@zoggyt Perhaps, that's why I had Georgia being really close and NC flipping, I envision the black vote being something crazy like 92% Ethan, 4% Keem.
@zoggyt As I said in the video suburbanites would be 100% against Keem, but both candidates would be terrible enough that turnout is really low among them, weakening their influence.
@zoggyt I feel h3 would do better in New Hampshire, it's a progressive bastion and favours candidates like him who would more appeal to the upper-middle class.
@zoggyt Either way, it would be a close election, this map is plausible.
@zoggyt I agree with you there, but with two hated candidates the election is decided by the turnout and I think more people would be enthusiastic for Keem than Ethan.
@ilymais @Neoncaffeine @BrodyFoxx
@Sub2Michae1 You from Ohio?
@zoggyt I don't think much will necessarily harm Keem more than Ethan. They've both said the n word and they've both made some oopsies. Like I said this would probably be a very low turnout election with both candidates in the negative approval ratings and it would be decided on turnout.
final map  
@zoggyt Advocating for left-wing populists doesn't necessarily mean you are one. I'm more talking about populist energy and style rather than populist policies.
@zoggyt Progressives are only electable if they are populist, this is why I heavily doubted Warren's electability, the polls clearly show this. H3H3 is progressive but not populist as I said, which would hurt him in these states.
@zoggyt I think Keem's populism would help him, similar to Trump 2016. Covid and the economy are turning WWC against Trump for this election but someone without the baggage of an incumbent would win.
@zoggyt @MeMelonYT @TheTurnz_ I unironically want to debate you, or anyone for that matter.

@BillBaines_ @RealBWC @JohnSwanYT I believe he is experiencing symptoms of a stroke.
"@cringe_panda Its been mostly completed for a few months now, some people working on segments for the video haven't given me their bits yet though.
The whole video is 2 hours+ long and I can't wait for it to be released."
@cringe_panda 4chan gonna 4chan lol. While working on my Soph video I actually found 38 4chan posts being pedo to her.
@cringe_panda I apologized for then. I was completely in the wrong, but this time I wasn't doing that.
@cringe_panda I wasn't saying I want to impregnate you, I was saying '10 kids is a lot, better start soon if you wanna have that many'.
@cringe_panda I wasn't meaning me lol
@DrFuhny no
i literally do not have down syndrome, autism or any mental stuff lol 
@cringe_panda better start soon lol
@SpookyNazi @EmperorLemon lol no, I was imitating Emp's face he always makes
@SpookyNazi @EmperorLemon That's the look I was going for

RT @GalacticTheHis1 : @JohnSwanYT 
@OhMarDayz Nah then I always have to go into the nest and stuff if it's all in one thing its easier
@ilymais @Swagga69420 nice
Horrible. Harassing her father on his deathbed about politics. What a way to end his life, by arguing with his daughter. 
@ilymais If you get cancelled over that, that's a different story lol. But I more mean deleting videos made a long time ago that you view as "cringy"
@RikkaIsMyGF They are a record of how your content has progressed and even though you may cringe at them now, you will regret the decision later. If you have 10 million subs one day, wouldn't you want to be able to see the first videos you ever made, how far you've come?
"dear youtubers:
DON'T DELETE YOUR OLD VIDEOS!!!"
may make a low effort (w/ facecam) gaming video on second channel next week
@ilymais @god If you set the pan on fire you're doing something wrong. Maybe try less butter next time?
@OhMarDayz You can be successful, you have potential
@JohnSwanYT @TheTwoon @RealBWC yuck
@Leafy @aid8nn he can't even vote lol
@Database1337 I'm sure you've had a lot of experience jerking off people
@JohnSwanYT For one video I had to use 480p footage. I put a 1080p background around it as a border to keep a semblance of quality.
@RealBWC Yeah, he never asked follow questions to Alissa Violet accusing Jake of having a casting couch because he wanted Jake to look good and that went against his motive.
@SpookyNazi the best one

Please further explain what you mean? I want to hear your reasoning as to why my opinions are ignorant (by definition all opinions are biased). Also the winners will be decided by a vote open to the public, not me. 
RT @Deji : I bet the dog dies
@LtCythix @MyUserLogic @h3h3productions @OhMarDayz @Leafy Are you not American?
@AckJigglen Disgusting. Salt and butter are the only things that can be put on popcorn.
I disagree. Republicans in NY/Cali and Democrats in red states have no power in elections because their state will always vote for one party. All votes should matter equally and right now people living in swing states are the only people whose votes count 
@zoggyt Pointing out any difference between races is racist and ignoring race is also racist
@lottasin would you consider yourself an e-girl?
well then... 
@Vampuffin True, although I would unironically support him if he does run
I am once again asking for life support 
@lottasin @_Davidplex idk about that. A 14 year old with a 17 year old or even a 15 year old with a 18 year old is kinda sus
@lottasin @_Davidplex I'd say 2 years age gap is max if they're under 18

@cringe_panda No can do, I don't have a paypal. I'm not even aloud social media (of course I do it anyways).
@cringe_panda how much likes for you to follow me?
@NewNoxlish nah just a fact of life 😔
All you people following me have 6 people as your line of communication. 
@NewNoxlish Why would you assume I don't?

@NewNoxlish I do want to lol
"@NewNoxlish Never had it and probably never will.
Unironically, replying to Sin's tweets is the most interaction with a female i've ever had."
@HighlandRocket Very hard to say. 10 years ago was 2010, which is nothing like today. There could be a Youtube competitor, there could be no Youtube, anything could happen in 10 years it is too far in the future to predict.
@Zero112788561 @HighlandRocket Probably an accident that will get fixed. Pewdiepie has fallen back into Youtube's favor since mid-2019.
Look, i'm no fan of @RudyGiuliani, he's a liar, con artist and weirdo. But he was obviously tucking in his shirt.

@nickodium @Theview_er 15 year olds aren't mentally ready to have sex.
@WillyMacShow @TUMYBOI_M8 I disagree. I don't respect him because he's too into 'the algorithm', it seems to me he cares more about success than making content people love or to have fun.
@nickodium @Theview_er 12 year olds can 'enjoy' and 'want' sex but shouldn't have it
@nickodium @Theview_er Wrong. A 5 year old should not be aloud to have sex with anyone. That is a moral almost universally agreed upon.

@commentarystats Leafy is different from most terminated channels. Youtube must have done something specifically for him.
@_ThePieman__ Its possible but unlikely. Most probable scenario of a Trump win is him winning Pennsylvania + Arizona + Florida
"Update on progress for the @h3h3productions vs @KEEMSTAR rap battle:

@_Davidplex @GeneralHayley A 19 year old should not be responsible for what they did at age 12.
@_Davidplex Yes you can say it was wrong, but they should be aloud in the community still.
@_Davidplex @GeneralHayley The repercussions are them apologizing and being shit on temporarily. I think someone can completely change in 5 years, if someone made a bad mistake once, it doesn't mean they should be ridden from the community forever.
@_Davidplex I disagree. What if at 14, you helped promote a false allegation but years later, you regret it, have apologized and done everything to undo the damage that it did. I think they would be deserving of forgiveness.
deleting in 24 hours 
@_Davidplex I think most times you can tell, even then I believe in benefit of the doubt. If someone deeply regrets their past actions, even if it is bad, they should be forgiven, like Logan Paul.
@cringe_panda Doesn't look like she's going to be retiring from politics any time soon though
@_Davidplex It depends on how young. If you are 11 or even 14, you will understandably mature and view past actions in a different light.
@cringe_panda @sewernugget What after that?
This is relating to drama a certain very young person was involved in
If you make bad decisions and you are very young, you deserve another chance.
@LtCythixdad @TeamYouTube also you accidentally posted the picture twice

Why imagine? Just do it. 
Fully grown adults should not be having sex with 14 year olds. It doesn't matter if they "look" fully pubescent 
@savexy1 @Kinoven2 @Leafy Yes, I am 15 and I have never even thought of breaking laws.

@nuitNo6 @Leafy A older person attracted to a person who is still developing is a pedophile, not just people attracted to people who haven't started puberty yet (which is extremely young)
@nuitNo6 Well I technically am agnostic but the chance of god existing is so small and I treat the universe like none exists so I am a practical atheist
@nuitNo6 how?
@nuitNo6 @Leafy Anyone attracted to children should feel shame
@sketchdweller @AndreiTerbea But if it happens then what?
@sketchdweller @AndreiTerbea I mean if two 11 year olds fuck
@nuitNo6 @Leafy How young do you think is the limit to adults being attracted to them?
@sketchdweller @AndreiTerbea If 11 year olds have sex what happens? That is below all European countries age of consent but they don't go to jail. Things can be illegal without them going to jail.
@nuitNo6 @Leafy Wouldn't older people be attracted to people who have completed or near-completed puberty though? 12 and 13 year olds who are menstruating but otherwise have no signs of puberty would not be attractive to almost every adult
@sketchdweller @AndreiTerbea Its a deterrent
@sketchdweller @AndreiTerbea 14 year olds shouldn't be having sexual relations
@CustomName4 @Leafy 14 with 18 is kinda creepy tho
@nuitNo6 Don't compare your MAP ass to me

@JustinWhang yes, good idea Justin Whang
@JustinWhang He's never trying to make a joke. It's not satire, it's not self-awareness, he's never joking. But he's so disconnected from reality, some of the shit he does is genuinely funny
Jaystations' channels have been deleted. We're looking at this as a good thing since our goals were never to de-platform him and yet they genuinely might have done so, given what we were about to reveal. The videos are still coming out, we just have to re-phrase a few things...
@Sub2Michae1 @SlushTV_ early
@SlushTV_ I like this
@Bowblax @KEEMSTAR @nerdcity I try not to worry about the numbers. Getting the facts right and making something slick is more important to me. I think you're right and maybe it won't get many views, but when we DO finally release it, what we're showcasing/revealing will mind-fuck all those end up seeing it
@KEEMSTAR @nerdcity

@KEEMSTAR @Gokanaru Referring to the original or the re-upload with plungers though? "I think this crossed the line" doesn't necessarily translate to "I think this video should be removed". Maybe you're right and it does, but I'd like to hear him say it
@KEEMSTAR Gok's video should not have been taken down but neither should "content nuke". By asking questions like this one, you are inadvertently gunning for it's removal. This will only continue to fuck everyone. The question you should ask is; "Do you AGREE that this video was removed?"

@mikemajlak @KEEMSTAR 31 minutes cut. You were worried about things said &amp; asked them to be cut, it led to other things being cut. To protect Logan &amp; yourself from looking bad, you ruined an entertaining conversation. Next time hit me up &amp; ask me to cut what I said, I might have done it as a courtesy
@KEEMSTAR please fucking tell me WHY @mikemajlak got a say on which parts were cut. I've been censored massively to the point where what I'm saying is taken completely out of context and it's nonsensical. WHY? Is it because he didn't like some of the things I said? This is some pussy shit

@Mistergloworm @LeonLush @ultrajoecomic yes and that's exactly why it's funny to me. I can't believe everyone falls for this every single time. Fat debate sparked, only real winners are the company because they're just a-lot smarter than their customers. Every single time
@bluefireify @LeonLush @ultrajoecomic it's not a mistake in terms of effectiveness. Look at how many fell for it and look at everyone talking about it, including us. It's both clever and shady at the same time. Those two adjectives often go hand in hand in advertising I think
@tealcisdawsony @ultrajoecomic rings a bell, but it would have been about 8 years ago, so can't remember
@LeonLush @ultrajoecomic big facts. When you consider their motive, they've done nothing worth clapping about
@tealcisdawsony @ultrajoecomic did you ever see that anti-racist skin cream commercial? (I think it was Dove) That shit was hilarious
@ultrajoecomic the funniest thing about it has gotta be all the suckers that got manipulated into thinking Gillette are actually trying to do something other than sell razors, especially when advertisers have been pulling this same stunt for decades

@VincentHatesGod I doubt they've approached him directly. But perhaps Keem and De Franco etc are hesitant to cover the story after seeing the blatant blacklisting of anyone even remotely associated with you. Not even an irrational fear and that's just insane if you think about it
@KEEMSTAR we should do a baited on it, it's ridiculous

@Naranja_Ninja @RealBWC if you can DM it to @massiveismental that'd be great. I'm not following up on anything, just nevertheless want to have all the facts
@Naranja_Ninja @RealBWC that's interesting, not what I was told at all and I heard it from a trustworthy source that was there at the trial. Strange
@Naranja_Ninja @RealBWC insane if true. I was told he won by someone who was at the trial. But if not true, since he's not in prison, under house arrest or anything I can't see how he lost
@NEX_to_Nothing he literally had like 50 chances already, everyone keeps falling for it
@Naranja_Ninja @RealBWC rape is a minor offence?
@FSpaceball @RealBWC nothing surprises me anymore tbh
@SpaceOink @Levi_Van_Dartel @FatCunnt the joke could not be more obvious, but I can't say I'm surprised
@RealBWC it is true, he's been back for a long time now, don't know why keem is just posting about it now. He won the court case so he can stream legally. Ethically is another question entirely
@ColossalIsBlazy link me stream please
@ElvisTheAlienTV yes

@sid_sriraman @DolanDark @PyrocynicalTV I genuinely do actually 
@DolanDark @PyrocynicalTV 
@Pinggaz @KEEMSTAR @anything4views I wouldn't but it's not the reason we haven't been making baited. I do really want to give the podcast one more real push over the next few months and pump out episodes. If we fail again, then I think I'll call it a day
@DeodorAnthony or better yet don't pander at all I reckon
@DeodorAnthony I can definitely think of examples where you're 100% right so yeah it really is a case by case basis thing I think
@DeodorAnthony idiots will watch anything though. The main thing I've noticed is; they don't really know what's good and what isn't so they use numbers to gauge everything. I reckon they'll stick around as long as the common perception is; "you're popular"
@DeodorAnthony for sure. But for example, imagine if you don't make videos for idiots, but someone who does, promotes it to idiots. You're gonna get idiots watching even if you didn't originally intend those idiots to watch. Basically, you're right but really only on a case by case basis
@DeodorAnthony a bit for sure, but so many mitigating factors beyond your control also

@PyrocynicalTV best video 
@ItsLucasReturns @PerkaholicTV word of caution though. The interview I did was GENUINELY the hardest thing I've ever done. I've got a ton of life experience and I was still out of my depth. If he gets one over on you in the interview and benefits, that's something you gotta live with for the rest of you life
@ItsLucasReturns @PerkaholicTV I mean I can't really see what's wrong with that. My interview was used in the court case against him and was nothing but a good thing, he benefited in no way from it
@ItsLucasReturns @PerkaholicTV situation over my arse, he was in court 6 months later. Separate from that, I don't think anyone should care if you interview a pedo peter, unless your interview supports them

@KingUnoriginal @StargateLord @FatCunnt @KEEMSTAR yes, you're concerned about a (tame) joke made about a wifebeater. But because you don't even understand what to be outraged over anymore, your broken brain is telling you it's wrong. In reality... you've just concerned yourself for a psychpath's feelings. Well done
@KingUnoriginal @FatCunnt @KEEMSTAR fuck off
@KingUnoriginal @FatCunnt @KEEMSTAR barely a joke, since it's literally what he does. Also I'm supposed to feel bad for making a joke about a wifebeater now? You guys are pathetic
@FatCunnt @KEEMSTAR sucks to be braindead
@FatCunnt @KEEMSTAR oh just fuck off, I'm not making fun of her at all
@FatCunnt @KEEMSTAR how the fuck am I being a cunt

can't wait till Christmas Eve so I can re-post the tweet where keemstar ran over a dog. It's pretty much the highlight of my year
@JustinWhang don't forget funny fishbowl effect
@TheLordVega doubt it, all they have to do is just not respond. It's such a grey area that even if it did go to court, they'd probably win anyway
@TheLordVega they're too big to fight, nothing anyone can do. I wrote multiple emails, ZERO response. I even spoke to the creators of cuphead, the song the game is used in, they didn't care that I was using it but even THEY couldn't do anything about it
@TheLordVega there's another one called CMG "Create Music Group" pretty much the exact same thing, they're the ones behind my last video getting claimed
@grandayy @KEEMSTAR @pewdiepie the article is straight-up bait. Purposefully shit for attention
"@grandayy @KEEMSTAR @pewdiepie ""literally be literally""

leafy?"
@Paradomix64 fake outrage breeds fake apology. They know they've done nothing, it's just convenient for them to apologize to save their own skin
@itsniallryan and money. The big ones all have a paypal link in their bio
stop apologizing for every minor slip-up and cowering before people pretending to be outraged. This is why they're winning
@LeonLush yeah you right. When comedians/youtubers/whoever cave to this shit, these fake outrage fuckers win and it just makes it that much easier for them to get away with it in the future
@LeonLush I don't really agree with that. Ricky said it best 
@Mrirish_ @LeonLush he didn't have to, he chose to
@LeonLush it's completely pathetic and I'm not even SYMpathetic since he backed down like a coward
@iNabberTV yup, because kevin hart is more popular than some random internet pedo. Therefore more money, therefore more "criers", therefore more idiots riled up, therefore more of an impact. Same thing every-time lol
@iNabberTV fake outrage has always been a thing, it's just a-lot more popular now because there's more money in it. Crying for a living is an actual job title now. These people are also big on censorship so they always call for "cancellation" &amp; that riles up all the impressionable teenagers
Red Dead 2 should've won GOTY but God of War was still pure genius, so I ain't mad. Those two games alone have made 2018 a great year

@JoeGaudi @LeonLush @ElvisTheAlienTV yeah I also read the books long before the show. Still enjoyed the show. It's erratic, case by case basis
@LeonLush @ElvisTheAlienTV we're old as fuck, we're probably an exception to the rule
@BatteriaYT @LeonLush @ElvisTheAlienTV didn't see that one tbh
@LilPakiVert @LeonLush @ElvisTheAlienTV yeah I really enjoyed that also
@Jacy2244 yes
@LeonLush @ElvisTheAlienTV doesn't work every-time, for example I despised the charlie and the chocolate factory one. Probably different because it was a direct remake as opposed to animation ---&gt; live action stuff
@ultrajoecomic @LeonLush @ElvisTheAlienTV hahaha
@LeonLush @ElvisTheAlienTV I genuinely enjoyed the movie and I'll probably enjoy the lion king remake also, probably even more so. I went into it for nostalgia reasons and was genuinely interested to see how they'd adapt it to live action. I think it depends on what you expect going in really
@joeylockwood @anything4views I can have an opinion though, I didn't say anybody needed to take it, did I?
@daytimefilms @anything4views said "most"
@joeylockwood @anything4views I feel like you probably just need to be chased by a wild animal in the Savannah. You won't be depressed then
@Ramskerr @anything4views understandable if your life revolves around YouTube. The trick is to not let that happen and have other hobbies
@khal_aros @anything4views need to get your facts right I think
@khal_aros @anything4views even as a youtuber I can confirm it's not inescapable. I can go without using the internet for months at a time and I've done just that in the past
@qkakakakakakak @anything4views that's the answer I think. Try not using internet for a week, you'll probably feel much better
@khal_aros @anything4views did you try leaving the internet for a bit?
@qkakakakakakak @anything4views if you've got other things like anxiety for instance, it's obviously that much harder and that's why I said this is only for "most". That said, you're on the internet typing this so perhaps you haven't tried everything I suggested
@khal_aros @anything4views yes, I truly believe it works in most cases. Exercise is underrated
@RealYungCripp @khal_aros @anything4views for you it's impossible, so I get it
@khal_aros @anything4views for some people it's hard, for others it's impossible. For most, it shouldn't be that difficult to turn off the internet and go for a walk
@anything4views I feel like depression can be cured for MOST people just by staying active, eating right and having something to focus on/strive for. Shut up at home, alone, glued to the internet all day every day is definitely going to poison your mind over time
@KEEMSTAR fake as fuck boyyyy
@sid_sriraman @grandayy @massiveismental yeah, been that way ever since I got account back i think
@grandayy nobody really knows because twitter has zero documentation on it. Probably closes certain doors for you. You won't appear in the "who to follow" tab for example. It's why my @massiveismental account gets more followers than this one even when I haven't tweeted there in months
@jak_mockery @dulhunty @KEEMSTAR @Twitch twitch staff just really like garfield I think
@dulhunty @KEEMSTAR @Twitch wasn't even anything visual, I just mentioned Garfield's asshole
@Lead3r_ @KEEMSTAR @Twitch not joking
@KEEMSTAR @Twitch a twitch staff member suspended me because I mentioned Garfield's asshole
"@Sunnyracc @ViddeBoy520 @KEEMSTAR

@JHebertSide95 @tommycsftp @massiveismental I hit up @netnobody he's the dude that got my account back to begin with and the only person I know that can do anything at all
@tommycsftp @JHebertSide95 @massiveismental haha yeah of course, but twitter never respond
@tommycsftp @JHebertSide95 @massiveismental when I got my account back i think they put a proverbial black mark against it which restricts me from search options and shit
@tommycsftp @JHebertSide95 it's restricted for some people and has been for months I think. If you go to socialblade @massiveismental an account which hasn't tweeted in months gets more followers than @ColossalisCrazy it makes zero sense

"@ImAllexx @iNabberTV don't even know what you're on now you weird muppet. Clickbait doesn't always equate to a lie, like at all, where was that even mentioned? 

Title and thumbnail TRUMP any other thing you can do by a ludicrous amount. Everything pales by comparison"
@iNabberTV they're redundant. I use one single word for my tags... "no". Title and thumbnail trump literally every other thing by a ridiculous amount
@ImAllexx @iNabberTV "release time, title, descriptions, tags" is the quoted tweet, only one of em' actually makes a genuine difference and that's the title,so at the end of the day you may as well clickbait. Best advice really. As for release time, erratic at best
@iNabberTV Tags are redundant. Timed release is erratic and often a gamble. You're right that titles can be shitter than others and that will 100% make a difference, but ultimately clickbait titles = best option anyway, so may as well do that. All in all, it's not particularly good advice
"@iNabberTV in other words... clickbait like a bitch

you really don't have to be too smart to clickbait, it's not some kind of skill. I don't give a wet one if someone clickbaits or not, but to say it's lazy to choose not to, is bollocks"
@MingDaal yeah

for those asking why... I was reading fan-fiction and there were some epic sex scenes. Anyways, I'm not perma-banned but got a strike and 3 day ban, so no streams for a bit
suspended on Twitch for 3 days, see you then
@kiandymundi many don't post opinions and just stick to the funnies because it's safer that way. When you have an opinion, people can disagree with it and on twitter, I mean... especially on twitter, people can hate you for it.

@KEEMSTAR Article 13
@YTCreators anybody free on youtube to speak over Skype and answer specific questions at some point in the next 48 hours? I can even record the conversation and upload it
@TheLordVega you were the one person I was gonna ask actually
@sealerss if article passes before leave, still fucked I think
@Gelkore @LeonLush money
"@LeonLush yeah all good questions. I doubt the VPN one and existing channel/videos will still be removed anyway.

Moving out of the EU I'm not sure... like I've been in Asia for months, but I'm still a British citizen so I don't know"
@iNabberTV @LeonLush 
VERY high chance of Article 13 getting through. It's got mainstream support. If it does, my channel will end up getting blocked/removed. What I'll do is make a new channel and have an American friend run it on my behalf. It'll be really annoying to do, but I WOULD start again
@WallaWallaBlong @LeonLush musicians who want more money
@LeonLush RIP I think it'll probably go through as well, it's getting celebrity support

@chillzhaha @Banks @shanedawson yes
@ColossalIsBlazy have to give me 50% for using my name
@Billy29094937 nope :(
@BamboniReturns did better than me
@gamerfrommars @OrdinaryGamers @defymedia wasn't it like 2013 when the big cash started coming in though?
@maxmoefoe @LeonLush it's directly responsible for making me a terrible person
@weston_vasquez @Redrobot3dX "professionally offended" is the best way I've heard it put, might steal that
@Redrobot3dX @weston_vasquez I remember when there was that Skyrim mod that let you kill kids, was literally the most popular mod for a bit. Not one person gave a shit then
@DOOM_BFG @cock_facee literally contacted me first and have tagged me in shit over 50 times at this point, because mad. But yes... you should have ignored ME
@OrdinaryGamers @gamerfrommars @defymedia back in the early days of youtube I think, before anyone started making real money. I can see the temptation, especially if you're young
"@SondreEastfarm there's no surprise
I care because it could easily happen to me and I'd want people to care"
@Redrobot3dX jesus christ
@KEEMSTAR the fact that you have to even dance around this shit now is just off-putting
"@DOOM_BFG @nopeifyaltalt ""still watch beheadings online""

the backtrack is real"
likes a good old beheading video, but feeding a woman to a crocodile in a video-game was just disturbing. The internet is just foreign to me at this point 
"@DOOM_BFG @CheesyPsycho @comet_mikey ""not criticizing him but he's not self-aware""
think you might be the one not very self aware.. At the end of the day, it's a video-game, it was a joke and the whole thing is ridiculous. Comedy is dead and cowards like you helped kill it"
"@DOOM_BFG @comet_mikey wait... wait... just wait a fucking minute here... you are calling me out for distorting shit and you haven't even watched the video?

AHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA

@DOOM_BFG @comet_mikey I said it was a funny moments video which it was, I didn't say it was a compilation did I. The other guy just can't read and neither can you
@comet_mikey who fucking cares

@Troupple @realbuntyking one of my favourite movies
@realbuntyking ye
@realbuntyking 2nd best show ever made
@nopeifyaltalt this makes no sense
@BamboniReturns I always thought it was way too overpowered, so I like the change. Yeah honestly I was watching gameplay and it's so fucking yellow, it's like someone squeezed a lemon on the lens
@VinalG4ce I've never really cared for Bethesda games in general. An abundant lack of main missions and far too many pointless side ones
@BamboniReturns I only watched a few videos, I like what they did with VATS. The most positive thing people were saying all revolved around the looting, which I've never cared for anyway. Is it me or did the graphics look abysmal?
@BamboniReturns I like the concept honestly, whether it'll be executed well or not I don't know
@AeromaticTV @PaleonAlt @iamzenYT it's called having a position of power on the internet, having zero fucking social skills and being a fat pedo peter

@justtweetinman hooplehead is the best insult
@LYNESTAR_ he is
a Deadwood AND Breaking Bad movie now? 2019 gonna be slick. It's never an easy transition turning a show into a movie, rarely comes together well, but I'm genuinely hoping for the best

i can't find a single moose in red dead where the fuck are all the meese at?
@nopeifyaltalt not voting
@bugmister11 here's hoping
not voting
@Gandelfas not really, it was to be expected
@PyrocynicalTV did I ask?
@CHoward014 yeah it's archived on youtube by someone
@DBDIAVENGER nah I think they got taken down and I didn't have them backed up
@ThePipLad @TitanTaff @Venmona2 we're done here
@sulimanas11 CLOWNED
@ThePipLad @TitanTaff @Venmona2 when are you gonna finally admit to being into furry shit?
@Vivalamm1 ty
@ThePipLad @TitanTaff @Venmona2 all I know is, it ain't a straight
@BamboniReturns I think with a game this size it's allowed maybe 3 of those. When Skyrim first came out, no joke, this must have happened to me over 100 times
@BamboniReturns damn, that's odd, haven't encountered a single major bug yet
@ThePipLad @TitanTaff @Venmona2 the plot thickens, were you lying about being a sexless loser too?
@ThePipLad @TitanTaff @Venmona2 so they finally allowed you to use the stapler?
@TitanTaff @ThePipLad @Venmona2 no
@TitanTaff @ThePipLad @Venmona2 I'm sorry but piplad isn't human and simply doesn't have a shadow
@ThePipLad @Venmona2 looks like you also devoured that part of your brain that makes you funny
@ThePipLad @Venmona2 you really are the next chapter in evolution aren't you
@ThePipLad @Venmona2 yeah we'll do one and you'll start crying again
@ThePipLad @Venmona2 yeah we should do more but you had a cry when you started getting called a mutant by people with pyrocynical avatars so we stopped
@Venmona2 @ThePipLad they're the worst things I've ever been a part of
@ThePipLad I may make a different channel, I just didn't wanna have to do that and I never used that 2nd one so it made sense
@ThePipLad anything with your face on it is automatically shit
@first_light9 yeah that's what I'll be doing, or may make a new channel, I don't know yet, people seem to want me to keep that 2nd channel the way it is... yeah i don't know
@bigmates cheers
@BanegaBooty @DBDIAVENGER back in 2014, only did two of them, they got shut down, but they were fun to make
@DBDIAVENGER gone forever unfortunately
@spiceytherobot every single video is demonitized and a few even got strikes, so I wish them the best of luck
@LeoFitzsimons @UpToHerCicatrix yeah at some point
@UpToHerCicatrix I have to move airbnb before I can stream again
@Joshand01 lol
no upload November
@AidanKind *weird game design
@jaubreyYT @KEEMSTAR it'll be the most out of context recording you've ever heard
@KEEMSTAR yeah cheers for making me record 5 minutes of pure insanity for it
@EdwardTemple11 doesn't count
@LordOdinO_colon &gt; witcher 3
@kevinoriordan20 I think so, I doubt we'll see a game like this again for a very long time
@EdwardTemple11 *2
pending the muliplayer living up to expectations, I may actually make a video for main channel on Red Dead.I think the game is genius and I'd even argue that it's the best game ever made despite the weird balancing stuff. The video would try and prove that I guess
@AidanKind i don't think so i don't think so
@nopeifyaltalt @DolanDark @rooting_around ^
@DolanDark @rooting_around facts here
@DolanDark damn, you the type of dude that has to use deadeye to find his own dick :pp
@PetriDishBoy @KEEMSTAR it actually fucked with his ego to see a balance of 5 dollars
@KEEMSTAR yes because you used a cheat glitch within first hour of playing, because you couldn't fucking STAND to be poor for a second, even in a virtual game. We've already had this conversation mungo
@MajorLeagueWobs not even that exaggerated from reality
@MentooTimesup @haydenwaltis it does, just not a lot of it. I've played 48 hours so far (approx) didn't use fast travel once
@thewavywebsurf I love the poker, though I wish they'd added more than ONE animation for when you win a hand. Like they got animations for the most minor things, but then something you are going to see A LOT of only one? That didn't make sense to me
@bunsenguy I think you're just rushing it and this game punishes you for rushing, which is a good thing imo
@bunsenguy I actually love that shit because it's hilarious
@haydenwaltis I absolutely hate fast travel in video-games so this was a breath of fresh air. As for the animation speeds, for single-player it's absolutely fine, but I DO hope they increase it for multiplayer otherwise it just won't be as fun
@BamboniReturns it's the best game I've played in forever. Rockstar suck at balancing though, I'm really really hopeful they get it right with the multiplayer
@papurrs GOTY for me, though God of War came close
@RealYungCripp haha yeah i saw that one going around a lot. It obviously makes the game the slice of genius it is, but in many areas take something away from the gameplay in a really significant way
@haydenwaltis work of art I reckon
@ErnestArts_ when multiplayer comes out
@DonkeviusMC I think it's one of the best games in the last 5 years so I would say now
Red Dead is a straight-up masterpiece. Some weird balancing though. For example, you've got 5 different types of bullets to 1 gun (overkill) &amp; you can only craft 1 bullet at a time. No downside over regular bullets, so you just sit there for 30 minutes holding down the X button
@Chill_Cams you are right, but I was also locked out of twitter till a few days ago
@ColossalIsBlazy @feelinyawave need to announce it again, because I think there were only 5 submissions last I checked
@UpToHerCicatrix still got lag so afraid not, my speedtest says my internet connection is solid, so not sure what it is. I'm moving airbnb so hopefully that'll fix it
@feelinyawave when I figure out how to fix the lag, may need a different internet connection
@KEEMSTAR 3. abducted by aliens
@KEEMSTAR yeah we're doing a baited on this I think
@FelixMcgreg I do yeah. I recommend Adobe Premiere Elements. It's very easy to learn and quick to use and only costs about 40 bucks for the full program. I use it for 95% of any video. I use AE for the more complex shit that elements can't do but NOT cheap and NOT easy. Start with Elements
@UpToHerCicatrix yeah I did respond, I'll definitely sort something out for them
@AimoAmadeusly tomorrow

@Signal600YT @LeonLush @YouTube yeah I don't like that guy
@charmedskull @LeonLush @YouTube it's just more youtube censorship at the end of the day, it's been snowballing for some time now and it's only gonna get worse i reckon
@Signal600YT @LeonLush @YouTube charity is a good thing, I'm a big believer in it. But I also believe it should always be a voluntary thing and not compulsory
@charmedskull @LeonLush @YouTube I wonder if they'll try and somehow disable streamlabs when streaming on youtube now. Wouldn't surprise me honestly
@Signal600YT @LeonLush @YouTube I think it's probably less selfless than all that, several people pointed out it might be tax deductible for youtube and some other stuff. In any case... it's a pretty dumb idea flying under something more positive that YouTube takes all the credit for. That's how I interpret it
@Signal600YT @LeonLush @YouTube it will, it 100% will

@nopeifyaltalt shut up today
@captnkyrsh ye, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the series. It doesn't have to have a big conclusion to be good. If it's entertaining, that's all that matters really. It was a bit drawn out, he should have slimmed it down, but a blowjob is still a blowjob at the end of the day
@LeonLush "a cool blowjob"
@captnkyrsh entertainment I'd say, it's the most important thing

"@SuckMuhBeef did I speak too fast or is your brain too slow?

Nah I get it, but you can also change the speed of the video if you need to slow it down a bit. Also I just watched with subtitles on and it's almost a perfect translation"
bonus episode of Baited 
@hoysity my tonight
@trinKaus__ @MrBeastYT @Aaron_Doh @owenvideo @robertoblake yes tonight
@MrBeastYT @Aaron_Doh @owenvideo @robertoblake I'd put money on it factoring in, but there'll also be other variables... I doubt it's based on ONE thing alone, so you're probably both right

@psychobartus MY tonight, it's still the morning for me
@nopeifyaltalt mission accomplished
@anything4views I'll link your pig livestream in the description where you reacted to his response, the one where you straight-up STOLE one of my points. Yeah I saw it, I saw it
due to Keem's twitter ban and a few timezone complications... tonight I'm gonna release a special bonus episode of the Baited podcast on the channel. No Keem &amp; Chad, just the best member of the podcast breaking down Philip's response so you guys get some context for next episode
@ElvisTheAlienTV what's funny is; he didn't even need to use his third party ad agency to deal with Betterhelp, he's got no overheads there. Dude is not doing much more beyond sending and responding to emails
@Zester you're an odd one
@Zester pretty standard isn't it
@nopeifyaltalt I don't think so
@nopeifyaltalt yeah you stole it from me
"RT @ultrajoecomic : drawing for the video ""FouseyTube: An Alternate Reality [2]""
 #fousey  #fouseytube  #Rose &gt;  "
@nopeifyaltalt it's not
and now they've removed ALL their video testimonials... I mean cmon'
@DCsir92 @pewdiepie good point
@Pinelyy @robvaran @pewdiepie yeah of course, it's highly unlikely... good to explore all possibilities though
@robvaran @pewdiepie it'd be crazy if true, maybe you get a price reduction for leaving a video testimonial... I'm wracking my brain honestly
@pewdiepie customer might've hired the actor to read it for him due to fear of being on camera. Why they felt it was THAT important to leave a testimonial that they'd pay someone to do it... I have no idea. I find it unlikely. Hopefully we'll discover more actors within the testimonials
@ColossalIsBlazy @massiveismental no
@Useless__Nobody @massiveismental smart
@carson78938959 @massiveismental tomorrow... I hope
@UpToHerCicatrix I genuinely do apologize, I honestly think I'll be able to tomorrow
@EternalVanguard the more the better
@semmler I think they'll already be involved now
@ChirsXBlade @JhbTeam yeah, it's literally just a task of going through and trying to compare the actors with the testimonials. It's a massive job, I can't think of any way it might be made easier
@dolan_dawg @Ryan_Bell2000 not sure yet
@Ryan_Bell2000 sorry mate, I will really try tomorrow, but we gotta get this Baited out
@TheOne713_ @Mikecashman82 @nicholas_deorio @Baited_Podcast @KEEMSTAR right and also, baited wasn't uploading for ages, now we're uploading frequently. It'll take some time, but we've doing well considering our hiatus
@Ben__Masta too bold a claim for me tbh, but it's certainly indicative of shady shit isn't it
that's just one but I guarantee there are other actors to be found in the testimonials, it's just a matter of finding them. Time consuming job to be sure, I spent 2 hours on it 3 days ago and found NOTHING. Fiverr isn't the only website where you can hire these actors also
@fangirlofyt still need to record it, I'm glad we waited though
@ThePatMann @stillgray @Dractonis just go to his fiverr profile
@Mikecashman82 @nicholas_deorio @Baited_Podcast @KEEMSTAR actually, not that's even important, but we are practically getting the same EXACT views we were when baited started ironically. Maybe you should check for yourself
@stillgray @Dractonis i knew it
@nicholas_deorio @Baited_Podcast @KEEMSTAR we get 100s of thouands of views per episode
@tok_toupee 
@DeadonDaveV @anything4views @JustTheTrueBob yeah no worries, I entered into the conversation to discuss whether or not this was a scam, that's all I was doing. I still do not believe the topic was set-up to exclusively discuss legalities and even if it was, it's MORE than fair to say one could easily misunderstand that
@DeadonDaveV @JustTheTrueBob Like I said, never intended to discuss this from a legal standpoint, I know literally nothing about US law, that WOULD probably be irresponsible were I to do that. Look at all my content, when do I discuss legalities of things? Rarely ever... always been more about the shadiness
@DeadonDaveV @anything4views @JustTheTrueBob also Dave there ARE a lot of facts beyond the terms of service out there already, obviously more theories than facts for sure, but there's enough for you guys to touch on more, just as we've been doing. Tommy and yourself have only really touched on ONE thing thus far
@patrickhobley @anything4views ok I will make sure we add in "gamble at your own risk" next time we are sponsored by them, that's probably fair
@DeadonDaveV @anything4views @JustTheTrueBob I think you were both idiots with this one for sure, but yes... time will tell :)
@DeadonDaveV @JustTheTrueBob I think my point from the beginning was ;that it's not in every case and there are plenty of "scams" that are not criminal. Therefore I have every right to call it a "scam" and it is not irresponsible in any way for me to do so, since it's fair to say it is
@anything4views @DeadonDaveV @JustTheTrueBob they are
@fruitbizzle that will of course be a point that's made
@DeadonDaveV @JustTheTrueBob I think you did with the whole "you know as well as I do" thing... in context to the conversation that made me out to be dishonest, which wasn't the case. If we go back to the conversation; the "scam always means illegal" part was never disputed or clarified by you in fairness
@DeadonDaveV @JustTheTrueBob mostly just a difference of opinion for sure, a disagreement. You both did put words in my mouth, I should probably be annoyed at that, but I'm actually not since it's twitter and things are too easily misinterpreted when presented in text format with character limits
@patrickhobley @anything4views I mean, it's a gambling site at the end of the day, not Coca Cola. As a youtuber you can't be too picky. I've turned down 100s of offers for my main channel, never done one, waiting for the RIGHT one. But since it's not my channel &amp; it's not a scam I'm happy to have it for baited
@patrickhobley @anything4views one is a scam imo, one isn't. No I'm not getting these sponsorships, Chad is, but I've raised these concerns with Chad many times,because of course I have. He assures me there is ZERO scam, I've looked into it a little myself and there's no proof of anything
@patrickhobley @anything4views 
@pewdiepie know what sort of time it'll be going up?
@MrDirkMcQuickly yup agree with everything, my thoughts also
@MrDirkMcQuickly yeah... I mean "clever" in the sense it'll easily fool the idiots and obviously that's worked since I'd say like 95% of people are on his side here
@JakeClave_ I agree that a podcast is not the best format, it's probably not something I'd make a video on though
@J0J0Aljar keem is keem, I am me
@FuvkTwetar I'm not
in my opinion Philip's response video actually makes him look worse, clever though it is. He makes good points, that will easily convince someone who doesn't know this story that well. I'll be breaking down his response on the next baited episode
@emz_sf @tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD their argument is literally that... semantical debate... as stated from beginning
@Gobdium @tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD what the fuck are you on about?
@Erzekett @tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD to be fair, he's normally fucking good in an argument but he's off his game today
"@tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD was it made after the question? YES
did he only focus on 1 element of the ""scam""? YES
was the vid a lawyer LITERALLY giving ""legal analysis"" YES
did he say a scam wasn't always something criminal? YES
is it easy to interpret the topic as; ""is betterhelp a scam?"" 100% YES

give up"
@tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD the question was: "is better help a scam?" I was answering that. It's quite clear from everything I've said that I was answering that. The "A legal analysis" part is less relevant due to the fact that it's not made part of the question AND a lawyer is literally giving "analysis"
@tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD from my viewpoint the topic is whether or not this was a scam actually and I think 99% of everyone else thought the same. I asked you why you guys are always making this about legal shit, because you do it a lot
@tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD that does not mean I have to automatically respond to it from a legal standpoint at all. And for the record I wasn't. I think even this point is weak
"@youtuberlaw @tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @PhillyD ok as a lawyer perhaps you might end this little spat for us...

Is a ""scam"" ALWAYS illegal?"
@tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD no it isn't. Why else would I say "why do you guys have to always turn this into a legal thing?" if I entered into a legal debate?
@tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD 
@aseellop @tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD I did look into it idiot, why would I be commenting on something I didn't
@tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD you're grasping at straws. Just because I replied to a thread where you linked a video from a YT lawyer doesn't mean anything. I choose my words carefully. If I wanted to come at this from a more legal standpoint, I would have said "this is criminal" in place of "this is a scam"
@TitanTaff @tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD I love when people copy/paste google definitions and think they just solved something. Words have multiple meanings in different contexts, settings and situations
"@DeadonDaveV @tommycsftp @youtuberlaw @PhillyD you are talking out of your arse Dave. You think I used the word ""scam"" to convince people of criminal activity? Get fucking real. It's not a buzzword, I just said it was not a buzzword and your ONLY context is:
""scam"" ALWAYS EQUALS ""criminal""... when it genuinely doesn't at all"
@tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD in addition to this Tommy, stop saying I should be using my platform more responsibly, not the first time you've said this. I make funny commentary videos on the internet where I call people greasy pigs. Perspective.
@tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD I call it a semantical debate because it's literally a semantical debate over the word "scam". Even going this route there are plenty of "scams" that AREN'T criminal. For this and multiple reasons I think your defense of this company is categorically flawed
"@DeadonDaveV @tommycsftp @youtuberlaw @PhillyD don't say I know something Dave, you're just putting words in my mouth

there are plenty of scams that aren't criminal. This is not some buzzword, it doesn't automatically speak to anything. You are defending a company with a piss poor semantical debate of a single word"
@aseellop @tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD when you get this caught up on one word, that's when you know your argument is weak as shit. Why bother to defend something that's clearly shady as fuck
"@tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD yup, semantical debate on the word ""scam"", just like I said. 

If I'd said ""this is criminal"" maybe it's a different story. It's not in any way irresponsible to call it a scam, you couldn't be more wrong and I think your argument is weak"
@DeadonDaveV @tommycsftp @youtuberlaw @PhillyD see what I mean... we're straight into a semantical debate on the word "scam". Weak deviation. I don't know US law, I don't need to. If I wanna say something is a scam, I can, it doesn't need to be criminal. Besides which, I can think of plenty of "scams" that aren't
@tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD why do you guys have to always turn this into a legal thing? I don't know jack shit about US law and I'd never claim to, but I don't need to to say "I think this is a scam". The quote isn't "I think this is criminal". You made this about something else I think
@tommycsftp @DeadonDaveV @youtuberlaw @PhillyD why do you guys have to always turn this into a legal thing? I don't know jack shit about US law and I'd never claim to, but I don't need to say "I think this is a scam". The quote isn't "I think this is criminal". You made this about something else I think
@tommycsftp @youtuberlaw @PhillyD might be a personal opinion, but it's not exactly like it's based on nothing. I see this could devolve into a semantical debate on the word "scam". Even if it transpired that it's not LITERALLY that, and I still think it is, who cares, shady company that's not worth defending
@Salter_Sam_ @tommycsftp are you joking? So if it turns out to be true that you went into a private session with a "therapist", discussed your mental health, they've taken what you've said and sell it to third parties that's not bad, everyone does that and that's a shit point? Get outta here
"@tommycsftp @youtuberlaw @PhillyD everyone just focused on the terms of service alone, it's literally only one element of the story that might constitute a scam

- employed counselors that AREN'T counselors
- counselors not even showing up
- very likely fake testimonials
- increasing evidence of data-mining

SCAM"
@Reaperpiss because he wants to manipulate others into thinking they're more positive overall, hence why he only deletes the negative ones

@RickyScurvy @Boogie2988 I can believe it honestly, I've already read that Betterhelp founder has had ties to it in the past

@RickyScurvy @Boogie2988 100% I'm still looking into the data mining thing, not something I know too much about

@raaachellouisee only unethical if the youtubers were aware, it's fair to say some of them were pretty ignorant of everything, but not all of them
@TomasVikingsson can't see how an office visit could "inspect their inner workings" since everything is done online and they're hiring "therapist" from anywhere and everywhere BUT the office itself
@Zacda2 might have to hold it off till tomorrow due to baited
@LittleCoolMe no video, just a baited I think
@AngryExpo I'll wait for baited to give my thoughts on it, but he didn't imo
@AngryExpo I don't think he was transparent at all
@RSInterestings @epichrist tonight
@epichrist too long a story, but it's the next topic on baited if you don't mind waiting till then
spent most of the day looking into this Betterhelp shit. Hope the website gets shut down
@TheBearHimself @iNabberTV I'm not saying it can't, I just don't think it can
@iNabberTV it's another story of greed. They prey on the weak, offer them a poor service and cruelly dismiss the most needing of it when the fire gets too hot. Most of the YouTubers that promoted it are only guilty of ignorance, but one or two fucked up big time
@iNabberTV I could never see it working. Bad idea. Course it's transpired to be so much MORE than just a "bad idea". The more I learn about it, the shadier it gets. I hope the website gets shut down

@AntonioChavezSN ah no not the counselors, the testimonials from people using the service, in particular the video testimonials
@TRexLesleigh yeah today
@triangleDAYS @CbdHealthy I personally think it's a terrible idea to begin with, just something that really shouldn't be done online

@anything4views @KEEMSTAR he's a narcissism
@stillgray slippery slope if youtubers could be held accountable for another's misinterpretation, no matter their age. But in any case, I think pretty much everyone's videos are mostly watched by teenagers. They're the main demographic and they've always dominated all others
"@stillgray ""most people don't know the difference between therapists and psychologists""

that's mostly on those people then I think. I didn't feel it was all too misleading. The therapist being a full-time youtuber was a big giveaway for me personally"
@triangleDAYS factual

@adam22 I think all the exaggerations (funny gasps) are for entertainment over obtaining any kind of relatibility with the viewer. Same thing when you watch Drama Alert and keem does that incredibly fake laugh. It's overreacting, but when you look at the intent behind it; not a big deal
@KEEMSTAR I told you I didn't want to be in the video
@JustDestinyYT use creator studio to remove the song you muppet. You've gotten really lucky, it's only used in the outro and won't damage the video(s) at all. You don't need to file a lawsuit... like... in any way
@nicholas_deorio @tommycsftp in fairness didn't seem like the milking was too much of an issue for him, but maybe I missed that. Long podcast. I liked how they called Shane disingenuous when comparing Jake doc to Fousey no jumper interview. Since everything they said about fousey ended up being disingenuous
@PyrocynicalTV SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU FUCKING SOCIOPATH
@TheShinPin imagine complaining about putting sociopaths in a negative light. Fucking crazy town
"criticism for big sociopath documentary is there but it's nothing worth having a seizure over. This man might be overdramatizing, but so are the complainers. The internet will always find a way to whine about anything, even if it's good content. 
No stream tonight, but tomorrow"
@tommycsftp most of it isn't really coming from youtubers but the youtube audience, I've only really seen that Geordie bloke have a little pig whine, seemed pretty biased to me. As for the viewers, they'll always be crying &amp; complaining about their free content, even when it's good, forever

@XxRaSaCkXx @BamboniReturns @Polaradical @grandayy @KingOfKazoos that's a pretty interesting point I think, I've never heard it before
@BamboniReturns @Polaradical @grandayy @KingOfKazoos see I bet I would have enjoyed witcher 3 even more if that difficulty was the only option honestly, I never felt a need to use of any of those items and I probably missed out on content. But I was too tempted to go for the normal mode
@Polaradical @grandayy @BamboniReturns @KingOfKazoos used Witcher 3 before as an example. I had little to no problem with that game at it's standard difficulty, wouldn't necessarily call it a challenge. Died a handful of times mostly for stupid reasons. I think if anyone played it on the storymode difficulty they had far less fun
@Polaradical @grandayy @BamboniReturns @KingOfKazoos yes but if you eliminated that option, my theory is the person who bought the game would actually get more for their money since they'd enjoy the game more
@AngryExpo @grandayy @BamboniReturns @KingOfKazoos yes and yes
@Polaradical @grandayy @BamboniReturns @KingOfKazoos i understand they're an option, but sometimes too many options are a bad thing. I'm completely shite at video games, you can ask pretty much anyone. But I have zero fun playing something that's piss easy. Too many tempted with the easy option and they end up having less fun
@Texassmufan @BamboniReturns @KingOfKazoos yeah, I mean that's what games used to be really, if you grew up with Nintendo or Genesis. They mostly had one difficulty setting and some were hard as fuck. Still haven't beat Contra: Hard Corps in 20 years, still trying to this day. That's real longevity
@PetriDishBoy @grandayy @BamboniReturns @KingOfKazoos yeah I mean shovel knight was great
@grandayy @BamboniReturns @KingOfKazoos yeah everyone likes different things. I'll always like the classic shit though, 2d platformers mostly that don't really worry about too much beyond the gameplay
@grandayy @BamboniReturns @KingOfKazoos maybe it's because I don't really understand games JUST in it for the story, it's not really a game at that point, may as-well watch someone play it on youtube, instead of spending 50 bucks on it at that point. Main reason I never liked Telltale
@EvilGiraffes240 @BamboniReturns @DirtyDanOnline @KingOfKazoos yeah it's dumb but they've also got it set-up so it's the complete opposite way round too. For some reason they don't think just having a constant balance between the two extremes is enough
@grandayy @BamboniReturns @KingOfKazoos take Witcher 3 for example, both combat and story is slick, normal mode was absolutely fine difficulty wise, if I had no problem with it, nobody should... they really didn't need an easy mode
@BamboniReturns @DirtyDanOnline @KingOfKazoos Bethesda games basically come with their own cheat engine
@DirtyDanOnline @BamboniReturns @KingOfKazoos Bethesda is the absolute worst for it. All those different difficulties really put me off their games
@BamboniReturns @KingOfKazoos yes, any game with multiple difficulty settings automatically made shitter imo. The only time it's good is if it's in the form of New Game+ or some kind of extreme mode AFTER beating the game at the ONE standard difficulty

@epichrist @HonorTheCall not what you originally said but ok, nobody gonna disagree with that. There's over a million channels dedicated to criticism and probably less than 100 "popular" ones worthy of criticism right now. Every single one of them will have been criticized already 100% Gotta be realistic
@epichrist @HonorTheCall yes, let's criticize a youtuber who hasn't really done anything that worthy of criticism simply because they're popular. Shittest mentality and you're not the only one who has it, half of the reason why everyone has a hard on for Ethan Klein right now
@HonorTheCall they will get attention, subs, views and $$$s with or without the videos, may as-well make the videos if they're gonna be entertaining. I think it's technically possible they can be brought down with a video, but yeah... very very very unlikely and will probably never happen ever

RT @maxmoefoe : To YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki: NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE ADSENSE AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT INTERNET HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE. I AM NO LONGER A CHANNEL THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMONETISATION &amp; AGE RESTRICTIONS. BE CAUTIOUS!
@guy_the_grape what are you on about, I started working on it less than a week ago
@MrGoose0 @KavosYT @PantslessGamers @RandomStuff_YTC @YouTube if both videos are about fousey then there's guaranteed to be at-least one egg in them anyway
@svartlnaggaroth philanthropy is a great thing. There are several youtubers that do it right, he's not one of them
@DavidBr21367780 how can I expand on that? Certainly not over twitter if at all. I mentally weigh up everything, using my own personal moral compass in order to reach an opinion on whether he's fair game or not. "Mental illness" is not a shield to avoid criticism in every case. Not in his case
@DavidBr21367780 criticizing anyone in the way I criticize them is immoral by definition honestly. The question is... how immoral is it? Calling him "a sick person" in this case is overreacting. Perspective is pretty important and when you have it, you feel he's fair game. I think he's fair game
@PantslessGamers @RandomStuff_YTC @YouTube he's not a kid though. The "mental illness" label has been laid on thick. You gotta put it in perspective, his "mental illness" isn't so extreme that he's dribbling in some asylum. In that case, yes, ok. But that's not the case. Not even close.
@PantslessGamers @RandomStuff_YTC @YouTube with this logic you can't ethically criticize someone who ate their family between two slices of bread. I get this is an extreme example but I'm just making a little comedy video on the internet about some dude off his nut. It's just criticism, I'm not telling him to die
@DavidBr21367780 he's always been pretty mental yeah. He's always lived in his own reality and manipulated others for his own benefit. Criticism warranted, was then, should be now too
@MassReflux original thoughts unchanged
@uncle_zed nice  idea but September 22nd is the date of the first one, too long a wait. Looking at early August before topic is dead
@DavidBr21367780 not going to convince you over twitter that this isn't just one episode of insanity. Wait for the video. Till then, remember I made the first one nearly 2 years ago and it's title still perfectly encapsulates everything that's happened recently. Proof enough right there I think 
@MsPerfParadox if you still believe this is a one-off with fousey and is just a result of him off meds... just remember the title of this video is nearly two years old and still encapsulates what's happened recently perfectly 
@khal_aros part 2
@TheBearHimself @chipmonkz he knows it, that's why he uses it constantly
@TheBearHimself @chipmonkz part 2 will be more humorous anyway, as the 1st was too serious. Even so, I don't plan on tiptoeing around anything
@EdwardTemple11 he uses his "mental illness(es)" in order to garner sympathy. It's very effective for obvious reasons. In reality, he's a worm that will use any tool at his disposal to manipulate others to his side &amp; reduce criticism. Whether it's mental illness or even religion. He's a phony
@YoungLion1997 I genuinely might if he goes anymore insane
@L0ST5ILVER it'll pick up from where part 1 left off
@YoungLion1997 no
@TheBearHimself I agree that fousey is a mental patient, but it's not a recent thing. He's as fake now as he's ever been
@saadpersonal gotta work, but any free-time I get basically
I liked Keem's doc, despite what some are saying. My main criticism is that he's far too sympathetic &amp; goes way too easy on him. Actually most videos I've seen thus far are a little too cautious in their approach. Don't feel sorry for him, so mine won't reflect that. 25% finished
RT @ultrajoecomic : wip 
@TrueSerpentCult it's not a mental episode at all, more like a mental "series". He's said shit like this many times in the past. Maybe he's not like it 24/7 but it's got little to do with one manic episode
@DetDeckard @Yoo_Tooba keem wasn't in on anything. All the false shit is from fousey and his team. Lies and deception, then convenient cover-up basically
@CommentCopped I will I will
@Yoo_Tooba he managed to fool idiots and children but that's not really saying all that much
@Yoo_Tooba sounds both
@manuel_leg I will cover them also yeah
I have to laugh at people saying "fousey was off his meds and that's why he broke down... leave him be". He's got you all fooled. Same person he's always been, on or off this... "medication". Here's a clip from when he was apparently still ON it, should all sound eerily familiar 
@MultiFamousDude yeah gotta be this month before people lose all interest in the topic
@Diggorymorrell so about 12-13 hours from now
@CornTheMighty all will be concluded
@grande1899 look at this positive outlook, are you fouseytube?
@r4bb17 dropped for now for this
@TacoZombie64 had to wait for the right time
@jdm_godzilla not that interested in it
I AM working on fouseypube part 2, dropped everything else for now. Hopefully I can finish it before the topic completely dies. Not too worried about repeating what others are saying, since there's a lot more to add outside of his failed event. Streaming tonight on Twitch also
@jdm_godzilla I am making part 2 of fouseytube hopefully I can finish it before the topic is completely dead
@Will__NE yeah you don't wanna watch any of the ones on fousey's channel, they're not gonna provide an honest account of what went down
@Will__NE this is most of it... not all 
@2Fast4YouFool he has a camera in his bellybutton
@realbuntyking you speak true
@realbuntyking the hustle is a lie
@realbuntyking they care because they're brainwashed
@thenerdcity when I saw the clip I immediately started working on the legitimate one. But don't tell anyone

6/10 I guess, go listen to DaBaby instead
Also I thought he said "racist" instead of "places"
You know the "why do the good girls like the bad guys?" song that tiktok kept using in 2019? Yeah imagine that but it's not as funny and it feels generic
I'm listening to that dream mask song thing, and like it's fine I guess, it's like every "eboy badboy" type of song I've ever heard and some of the lyrics made me laugh because of the bad delivery

@jadeechonn Oh God dammit, right when Harley made a terrible video on him
ayo hold up why does the thumbnail look like Luke Groomed Harley
"in a nutshell, this is like adding fuel to a fire nobody cared about anymore. 
Did Luke slander and try to manipulate Harley? probably. Did Luke silence Harley? No."
i just saw Harley's new video and I think it's really bad. it adds nothing that we didn't already know about Luke, it just adds upon what we knew. the title is also really bad because this was mostly about how luke can't take criticism, Not about how luke silenced harley.
@em_dee_ess so what if im a John Swan stan? we're all just having fun, we're not hurting anyone and we're just stan accounts like everyone else. what's important is to have fun. who cares if i enjoy being a John Swan stan? why do i have to be private quote retweeted for being who i wanna be?

Let's say that skipper did steal his idea. Okay then, who cares? A commentary iceberg doesn't add anything to the conversation, and nobody owns an idea, so yeah. I think this whole thing is cringe
Wait I just looked at pieman's tweets, and he thinks he was right about the thing with skipper? He uploaded the iceberg publicly, so now anyone could use it. I don't get what fucking argument could you make that skipper stole your video idea after knowing that.
Imagine you forgot to put the y in tyranny and then you get called transphobic

"@Amberoseone Wait I just figured it out

You can't have one without the other. You've become more happy after you've gone through something sad, and vice versa."
RT @nicholasjdeorio : John Swan who! 
@nicholasjdeorio Alright here's the same video except Nick's mouth isn't clipping into himself every 2 seconds 
@Amberoseone B-but the sadness gives you no benefits
Fuck dude I thought asexual people reproduce asexually. That's what asexual animals do, right?
@mister_baecon @Amberoseone Yeah now the tier 3 happiness subscription is the best subscription there is.
@mister_baecon @Amberoseone Yeah well, that makes you sad AND a loser, so I don't see why you would keep it around
Wait they don't? 
@Amberoseone Woah there buddy that's not a good idea. Idk why you would cancel the happiness subscription when the sadness subscription is just there being useless
I love how everyone is using the wombo ai thing
Alright I have a 1 hour break
@AugieRFC 
@zaptiee Tired of women but scared of women
RT @breaker_main : #TouchGrass since you guys cant go without 5 minutes sexualizing people or doing messed up shit 
Why do small commentators flip flop sides all the time when it comes to allegations and then apologize when they get called out for it. I genuinely don’t understand how you guys don’t realize that acting like fools is going to be remembered if you were to blow up. 
@CordWit Wow! I will now subvert this joke by saying I'm not single!

2. That also doesn't matter because they're still using them as if they're real

3. I don't really know enough about rythril to debunk this one"
I had the random ass idea of drawing @nicholasdeorio as majin buu. Here's an early sketch/doodle of the head

@AugieRFC Dude put himself in the same tier as nick and Tom lmao

RT @BitchAssBowie : people swearing off Burger King now as if their food was ever good lmao
@MrBadOptics @vichoparrapavez I disagree with that example because the difference is that a trans man is still a man, so it's less about your sexuality and more about preference
@MrBadOptics @vichoparrapavez Alright but the idea that someone made an entire sexuality just to exclude trans people sounds transphobic, no? There's definitely is some people who just prefer cis people, but the core idea behind it sounds transphobic.

@VerumZero Competitive simping
@vichoparrapavez @MrBadOptics I know it wasn't made for transphobes, but let's be honest, it's the transphobes sexuality
@Bowblax @nicholasdeorio I'm more of a Blaire Grey kind of guy myself

RT @BEN_SHAPlR0 :

@dumpylol Yeah it's not bad if they consented
I think it's funny that young bowblax was talking to these people with these 300$ mics and deep voices while he had a 5$ mic and had a high pitched voice
@Bowblax Tipster news? Ew! Drama Alert? more like.. Gay alert, now this is a good news source
@nicholasjdeorio @AugieRFC That's Nick's dad
@nicholasjdeorio @AugieRFC I am gonna address these claims by saying they're false.
@nicholasjdeorio @AugieRFC Alright but do you think Mr DeOrio shares his food?
@nicholasjdeorio @AugieRFC I'm skinny
@AugieRFC You got me hungry augie, how dare you
@bowblax_s Lol what a loser, can't relate
@nicholasdeorio I think it's even more cringe when there is small commentator drama
@MrBadOptics alright i'll take it, it's basically even
@MrBadOptics i would kick your ass
@Amberoseone look, if it doesn't make you happy or you don't like it, is it even what's right for you? "what's right for me" always felt like a vauge term, but it should probably mean a pursue of happiness, instead of trying to be successful, or "what i must do".
@nicholasdeorio I wish burger King was based and didn't make that thread
@Amberoseone No

@nicholasdeorio Can't believe bowblax is an overweight woman
@Amberoseone Yo let's go, you're back
"@Taps77w Then uh...
Idk what arc you should start"
@Taps77w This is where the based Twitter arc begins
Alright that tier list Nick is doing is bad because a lot of the youtubers on there have commentators that basically don't do commentary anymore or straight up non-commentary channels
@PhilCall5 Yo @nicholasdeorio is trans?
@LuffyzMonkey Bro they were fucking Wilding out
I can't believe I deleted this banger 
@BowbaxsSoftBoi Okay but actually, nick DeOrio was ranking ricegum, and Rice gum was the guy that said "did it feel good tho" when talking about a raping, and tipster tweeted that quote, and now everyone is tweeting it.
@BowbaxsSoftBoi I'm just not gonna tell you the reference to make it funnier
So true! 
I'm pissed that George floyd gaming got put into cringe, he was a great commentary channel, maybe even the best
@LuffyzMonkey @BanishedJourno Yeah :)
did it feel good tho?
@BanishedJourno Ricegum is best YouTuber for that one 
@LuffyzMonkey This one? 
@AugieRFC Lol I had the same experience when I went to Mexico after 2 years of not going, I only had 5gb of data and I wasted that shit quickly.

Look if you've seen Mexican restaurant logos you realize that speedy isn't that far off from being one of those logos
@vichoparrapavez @Amberoseone I thought the same for this reason as well
Speedy Gonzalez is the best cartoon rep for mexicans 
@crafter_porer "Big chungus Keanu reeves 100 wholesome moment" is the best way to describe this account

"@Amberoseone @vichoparrapavez Wait is Nick's Little feeder a girl?

@vichoparrapavez I mean it's weird that anyone would run an account with this name, but yeah
"@Dr_Neo_ Neo I almost didn't recognize you for a sec lol
Also thanks :)"
@Amberoseone Aww thanks :)
@vichoparrapavez Wait what, why did you think I was a girl? This this because I said I was a femoid one time?
Mike looks like MeatCanyon, so I'm siding with him

It's a 2 hour class."

Here's the "finished" version of the Gohan drawing.

Waking up to all this John Swan shit was interesting to say the least
I mean I think its a little funny that John was trolling HarleyTBS the whole time, but it's sad that he had to lie like this. Now he lost credibility and trust from the commentary community
Okay so in a delete tweet, I said that the drama was gonna end with John Swan confessing that he did it and dream looking like a cuck, and I was right

@Amberoseone Such a good state man
@vichoparrapavez Yep
@vichoparrapavez it's not good, but it's not really bad. pieman's editing wasn't great, and a lot of his points were really bad and some stemmed from stuff he can't fully prove. one of his best points though was that john wrongfully said stuff like pieman was suicide baiting.
the pieman situation is cringe, the only thing i dislike pieman for is igniting this drama, but other than that, he did nothing wrong. john, ay star, and other handled this badly in my opinion.

@Amberoseone Alright so how do you want to die?
@IsnAkira Politics 
Yeah you know what, after reading the thread carefully, it's a bad take. Salty implies that it's the streamers fault for using edgy humor when they get canceled for it.
Although you only need to be funny to be a good comedian. Everyone always says "you can't be a good comedian if blah blah blah" but the only 2 things that would make someone a good comedian is that they're funny and that they don't need to explain the joke or hide behind satire
I can't tell if this is a good take or a braindead take, but I'm gonna say it's a good take if this isn't talking about anyone specific. 
@Dr_Neo_ Good morning

NEVERMIND I AM NOW DECLARED THE NUMBER ONE NICK DEORIO FAN, THE OTHER ONE LEFT SO I HAVE THE TITLE

"@Sygnal3 interesting idea, but perhaps it works based on ip rather than set location
i'll try"
@LtCythixYT i have to wait until october lol
@Lilmaneyt a mark on the community like the mark on your pillow
99.5th percentile in terms of active twitter accounts isn't hard. If I tweet more on my main and get to I reckon ~5000 followers I can get verified.
I don't just want verification for bragging rights or stuff I actually get impersonated so it'll be helpful lol.
If I grow my twitter a bit more I think I can get verified. The verification requirement is "follower count in the top .05% of active accounts located in the same geographic region.", as I am Australian it should be easier because no one lives out here lol.

@zaptiee @WillyMacShow @AugieRFC you've all been so helpful to me and given me some great advice. I also watch all you guys' videos because they're always so good and entertaining. I look up to all of you.
@HarleyTBSYT I know we don't know each other that well but I feel we would get along, we've had some similar experiences and you're a bit of an inspiration to me. We should talk more often :)
@StellaVindicta @CordWit you have been incredibly nice and positive to me and you are way too apologetic about what happened in December, I've already forgiven you so many times lol. You have more than made up for anything that happened. Keep being awesome
"@TheTurnz_ and Alibi (lol forgot his twitter)
we're not as close as we used to be, but you're great podcast co-hosts and funny people"
@lottasin things got weird between us earlier in the year with me liking you and all, but I'm glad we've been able to put that behind us and stay (somewhat) friends, because you're hilarious and smart and talented.
@KrzearYT @JalynIsHere we got into beef before (that tbh i didn't/don't care much about), but i'd say we're friends. Krzear you provided a stepping stone for me into the community with that commentator chart and Jadyn I shared some personal experiences with you which was nice
@BdankYT @aidinfunny @TheRealNoxlish @smartayylmao I barely talk to you guys anymore but you were staples of the 2020 small commentary community, you helped make last year pretty fun and i appreciate that
@sweetieisbad honestly I think you're the best artist in the community rn. Keep up the good work, and you're also fun when we vc with Michae1 and others. Also you make epic tweets
@iamchiefyt you're such a positive dude and also an underrated youtuber. You deserve so much success and you're the definition of cool
@Lilmaneyt @Krazzf @GayAreZee you guys are cringe sometimes but you're epic people who i consider friends. Keep up the funny tweets but try and tone down the cringe lol
@jadeechonn I've only really started to talk to you in the last few months, but by now you're one of my closest friends. You're always happy to talk to me when i'm not feeling great and you post funny tweets, you're all-round a good friend
@_AlexTheLoser_ in the time that I got to know you, you became a very good friend. We got into 10 hour discord calls and made up tons of inside jokes, you were always so fun to be around. It's sad you're gone and you're prob dealing with shit rn but i'll be here when you get back
@LtCythixYT you are the purest person in the community. While sometimes you can let things get to you, I always know your heart is in the right place every time and you always do what is right. You're also the only person who has 100% stuck by me through ups and downs❤️
@Sub2Michae1 what can I say, you're my best friend and you've always looked out for me. You've helped me out a ton, you're as good of a friend I could ever imagine and you're a beaming light of positivity in the community. I love you man.
I wanna make an appreciation thread I guess. Notifs may be annoying so if I tag you feel free to mute.

"in the future.
It is a mental illness but of course it doesn't invalidate them and they still are whatever gender they identify as.
But being valid doesn't mean not identifying with your bio gender is not a mental illness."
"Of course being transgender is a mental illness. It is biologically not normal and causes great suffering for people who are it. I wish and I'm sure many people wish they weren't transgender and it would be a good thing if somehow we could ""cure"" gender dysphoria

@jadeechonn nah thats fine, i'm more talking about the people who obviously try to hide their face as much as possible
"im turning 16 in a couple hours
I want to be on call with some friends when the clock strikes midnight but idk if they're awake lol"
"show your face or don't

don't wear glasses and a mask and a hood to try and cover everything up, if you don't want to be seen then don't turn your camera on"
Carlos inciting an ad boycott of youtube 
Carlos calling people who use youtube (including him?) monsters 
so much hypocrisy for the video

"@jadeechonn true
jade is always right"
@jadeechonn you have made the correct choices
Two must be eradicated from the internet, which ones do you choose? 
@JohnSwanling @HarleyTBSYT Yeah this. Its very difficult if not impossible to really understand what people with mental health issues are going though if you haven't gone through it yourself
@CordWit I guess. And usually the big commentators themselves take criticism well, its the other smaller commentators who bash people criticising larger commentators.
@CordWit However Angelika is more of a tea channel than a normal "commentary channel" is she not?
it's literally hours long, so of course it'll take a long time to make
I am still making the commentary iceberg video, I'm just making this video in the meantime because I got a bit burnt out of writing tens of thousands of words for the same video
@OhMarDayz_ a lot of "small commentators" are terrible, but I do feel as if there is quite a bit of elitism
The only people who are "allowed" to criticize big commentators are other big/respected commentators. If you're anyone else you're just "clout-chasing".
@tatymaty__ no
lol the way i act online makes me look so right-wing but i'm actually not
@HarleyTBSYT It's true. People care so much about internet drama they forget there's a real person behind every screen.
@HarleyTBSYT The sad truth is that most people don't care about it because they don't understand it.

@tatymaty__ @_ThePieman_ sounds like a plan
@DeeeTgg @ononoris @_ThePieman_ nah my parents were really strict on not letting me have a yt channel, if i were allowed a channel I would have kept it
"@ononoris @_ThePieman_ i didnt actually have one
I was only allowed a yt channel once I turned 15, and by then I was interested more in commentary"
@ononoris @_ThePieman_ lmao I lied so much on Reddit
@AugieRFC Yes that would definitely be helpful editing practice lol.
Trying to replicate other youtubers' editing style is the most helpful way to practice editing for me

@krazzftoo @Taps77w @Vampuffin yes
@krazzftoo @BasedSerbian @Vampuffin @Taps77w i have witnesses who can testify about how obsessed you were about gay porn
@krazzftoo @Vampuffin @Taps77w you did, also you talked about it first
@krazzftoo 
@krazzftoo @Vampuffin @Taps77w then why did you spend an hour talking about gay porn in a vc (not a joke, and he kept doing it after people told him to stop)

@alfieisntfunny @RadsterrYT 
@alfieisntfunny @RadsterrYT do you not know what a subtweet is? You called me out over subtweeting literally yesterday
@Cam_I_YT @Harrisingle @jakontrary lmao way more unbelievable than anything you've doubted about me
@alfieisntfunny @RadsterrYT It is about a subject that started because of my situation months ago. You agreed with a tweet that said what you thought I did was "fucked up"
Ironic that the people who "like to do a little trolling" are apparently blocking tons of people lol 
"I called out a bunch of small commentators for begging for a follow so they decided to non-stop attack me, lie to me to get me to get involved in drama, deceive people about my past, twist/take out facts and compare me to pedophiles.
lol at how fragile their ego is"
@jakontrary proof?
@jakontrary @Arlus @alfieisntfunny @DeeeTgg Nah I'm telling the truth. You can not believe me if you want but the truth is the truth
@DeeeTgg @jakontrary @Arlus @alfieisntfunny I didn't think of it for hours. I literally basically didnt think of it. I admit I shouldn't have sent it and should have thought more carefully.
"@jakontrary I know you're quote tweeting to try and get more likes or whatever to your tweets against me, you could have just replied, but anyway.
I was confused and didn't know what I was saying. I didn't mean that."
@jakontrary @Arlus @alfieisntfunny @DeeeTgg I wasn't thinking straight. Like I said I was confused and said stuff I didn't mean.
@DeeeTgg @Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny @jakontrary i wasn't thinking straight when i was writing those messages
@DeeeTgg @Arlus @alfieisntfunny @jakontrary i wasnt once i found out she was 12
@jakontrary @Arlus @alfieisntfunny @DeeeTgg I didn't mean that. Like I said I was sexually confused and I didn't know what I was saying.
@Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny @DeeeTgg @jakontrary I'm saying it was jokes that sort of turned me on in a way. It's not backtracking.
@Cam_I_YT @Real_aMac @_ThePieman_ I have said this before. Maybe you just weren't paying attention
@Arlus @alfieisntfunny @DeeeTgg @jakontrary I was 15 I thought she was 13, what's the big deal there lol
@DeeeTgg @alfieisntfunny @jakontrary by a 13 year old yea, what's the problem
@Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny @DeeeTgg @jakontrary It was jokes that sort of turned me on in a way. It was like the "grooming" jokes nowadays that people say.
@Harrisingle @alfieisntfunny @DeeeTgg @jakontrary correct
@alfieisntfunny @DeeeTgg @jakontrary BEFORE I found out her age. When I thought she was 13.
@jakontrary @Harrisingle @alfieisntfunny No I didnt.
@jakontrary What? I've said this many times before. I wasn't actually turned on by her at all once I found out she was 12. I don't see the problem.
@DeeeTgg @jakontrary @alfieisntfunny I wasnt turned on
@jakontrary @alfieisntfunny I made some poor word choices (I wasn't actually "turned on") because I wasnt attracted to her at all after I found out she was 12, but the sexual jokes exchanged before I found out her age did turn me on a bit back then so i was sexually confused
@fxckjayms the mother
@jakontrary @alfieisntfunny I made some non-serious sexual jokes when I still thought she was 13 (as did a lot of others), and then once I found out she was 12 I stupidly told her I was very disgusted and that I was sexually confused at what happened. I also made some poor choices of words.
@DeadMemeFrog @alfieisntfunny I agree. I shouldn't have subtweeted, and I provided names once ALFIE called me out on it.
@alfieisntfunny yeah mention me by name next time instead of subtweeting. Also I never sexted her, stop spreading misinformation.

"@DeeeTgg @Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny They do. I can criticize people I don't like without a big reason why.

@DeeeTgg @Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny i find his content boring, that's it. It's not a whole exposed thing I was just voicing my unpopuar opinion.
"@alfieisntfunny @DeadMemeFrog But you do some of the other things I mentioned in the tweet. I was just listing a few things which people in your friend group often do.
This is why I didn't want to name names, but you pressured me to."
@Cam_I_YT @DeeeTgg @alfieisntfunny So? It came to my mind. Why would I need to wait for something to happen to criticise someone's content?
@DeeeTgg @Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny I critiqued him because I don't like his content. Have you ever considered that as a possibility?
@alfieisntfunny @DeadMemeFrog I was generalizing your group of friends, whom many do.
@alfieisntfunny @DeadMemeFrog I wasn't talking about you specifically I was talking about a lot of people in your group of friends
"@DeeeTgg @Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny ... I'm waiting
idk where you got that idea lmao"
@alfieisntfunny @DeadMemeFrog I don't interaction farm or beg for attention from big creators.
"@DeeeTgg @Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny No I wasn't?
Give me any proof whatsoever."
@DeeeTgg @alfieisntfunny In fact his opinions I would say is even more of a feature than him just reading out someone else's stuff like in a BWC video.
@DeeeTgg @alfieisntfunny I don't think that's true.
@alfieisntfunny @DeeeTgg I don't think that is most people's opinions. You guys are the only people I've heard that from. In my opinion, a long interview with someone's opinions is enough for it to consist a feature.
"@DeadMemeFrog @alfieisntfunny good for you
I don't."
@DeeeTgg @alfieisntfunny No you don't
@DeeeTgg @Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny I think accusing anyone who criticises someone else of "just wanting a block" is stupid. I said I'm not a fan of him, that's it.
"@alfieisntfunny @DeeeTgg He does say his opinion on a topic, just without his voice.
As an example; EmpLemon does the same as I did here: "
@DeeeTgg @Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny not at all, I think TRO is a nice guy and I even told him that in my reply to him.
@Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny how
@alfieisntfunny I think that 5 paragraphs of an interview is enough to consider him having a part in the video. Other large youtubers have done the same thing before.
@DeeeTgg @alfieisntfunny He was there, his voice just wasn't in it. You don't need someone's voice for someone to be in the video
@Cam_I_YT @alfieisntfunny Am I not allowed to voice my opinion on a creator?
@alfieisntfunny I know cobra made that shit point and you all go with what he says cause you're buddies but the "i clickbaited clown" thing is pretty stupid lol
"@alfieisntfunny I put ""featuring colossal"" because I had a 5 paragraph interview with him. Like I said, you don't need someone's voice to be in a video for them to be in it.
Again: You DON'T need someone's voice to be in a video for them to be in it
And I don't interaction farm lol"
I agree with this take and always have. 
@alfieisntfunny Then when have I ever acted like I'm better than anyone else? I criticized you guys over acting desperate for attention if that's what you're talking about.
@alfieisntfunny I have criticized others before, that is true. But that's not a problem because all commentators including you criticize people too.
@alfieisntfunny I'm no better than anyone else and I've never said otherwise.
muting all these drama conversations 
@Arlus what? i talk about commentary a lot. Yeah I'm a commentator lol that's what i do
"@alsike_xiv @ononoris @alfieisntfunny he was in the video, voice doesn't need to be in a video for someone to be in it

and i want to see this ""nuclear"" evidence"
@jakontrary @alsike_xiv i dont beg for follows
"@alsike_xiv @ononoris @alfieisntfunny my collab had 5 paragraphs of an interview. Like I said you don't need someone's voice for it to be a collab.

Where's the evidence of me going for the popular opinion, I want to see. Also I'm known for often going against the popular opinion so why would i do that"
"@alsike_xiv @ononoris @alfieisntfunny you don't need someone's voice in your video for them to be in it

i changed my john opinion only after i found out he lied

i don't interaction bait"
"@alsike_xiv @ononoris @alfieisntfunny how am i obsessed with clout
i want to hear it"
@ononoris @Taps77w so you dont want to mention how you guys tag some big youtuber in a tweet begging for attention and get all your friends to rt?
@alsike_xiv @ononoris how
@alsike_xiv @ononoris true
yeah lol talking about alsike, jako, alfie and associates if you couldn't tell. thought it was obvious 
@Arlus how
@JohnSwanling :\
@alfieisntfunny ok i will
@DeeeTgg same thing lol
"@DeeeTgg ""fear of being overtaken""
lol you resort to the ""ur jealous"" argument?"
@DeeeTgg you really don't get the point do you...
@tatymaty__ perhaps
@ZaptieTheBear @Child_Groomer
@MenguinPan @jakontrary @MomentsTweetor are you this desperate?
"@DeeeTgg i'm not solely focused on what will give me success/relevance and will do anything for it
that's the big difference"
@Taps77w 
@sinfullymyself the eternal battle
@DeeeTgg not at all, there are a lot of differences pal
@CablZone 🤔
@DeeeTgg just making sure they know i know what they're doing
@StackziesYT yeah dw i have the same thing sometimes lol
@jadeechonnart think of the people most desperate for any relevance they can get
@jadeechonnart a particular group of small commentators who do what i mention in the original tweet.
@jadeechonnart isn't it obvious
@HayleyAutumnLad you're not who i'm talking about
@TiredCast nah you're all good
you think no one notices lol?
@ZaptieTheBear nah i'd say 6
Dear the group of small commentators who all retweet every single one of each other's tweets, jack each other off, act better than everyone else and will desperately do anything to get a bit more relevance: ur a bunch of fags lol i know what you're doing

@XLucarii lol i have other hobbies too
I remember a year ago I was trying to explain the Keemstar h3 drama to people at school and they just wouldn't get it

@GayAreZee hi

@CommentaryLs yeah so what lol i can't say a celeb is hot?
@CommentaryLs but she's hot
"...

@PunishedBLAXX @punisheddogg lmao pedo moment
@n1k0lol no

@ZaptieTheBear if you had the chance you would
@punisheddogg except i'm more than a year younger than her lol
1 more year 
anyone who says they have never said the n word, even in private, is lying
@krazzftoo what happened?
"be yourself" is such cliche advice, but its something most commentators really need to take in
@mschneider2005 you don't even need to be religious to appreciate bible verses. Some of the bible is great advice no matter your beliefs.
@FridaysOVPyro yes
i'm seriously considering this
lol i should make a video titled something like "dream next minecraft manhunt leaked" and the actual video's just me shitting on dream and calling his fans retards and saying the n word
@michae1wastaken it begins.
"who cares" is not a proper response to criticism of your content
@Neoncaffeine the US ambassador to Israel on 8 June 1967
@faithvalntyne25 shit 
don't e-date
@Federalhood chris is actually funny and i would never take that back
@fultsex at the time making it public didn't look like a bad idea. It was reasonable to do it. Hindsight is 20/20
"Why does karl even have any stans? He's the least funny, most boring member of the Mr Beast crew

chris is the best"
@LtCythix_ lol its a tommy c quote
@fultsex Look you dipshit, instead of attacking my friends who thought one of their closest friends was literally dead, why don't you be glad that arz is ok like the rest of us. We made sure he was alive and he was so I don't see what anyone did wrong.
i'm also gonna make topic commentary on my channel, but only when there's a big drama and it'll be more pyro/slazo-like than gameplay commentary
RT @DeadMemeFrog : I’m just saying, wouldn’t you want to make sure your friend is okay if he can potentially hurt themselves? People really need to stop shitting on @LtCythix_ for this.
lmao

@Real_SolarYT too soon
@unovaIia @DoktorSkippy bruh he's not even the biggest iceberg channel 
every video on the predator poachers guy has been about him being "racist" rather than him using real minors as decoys, something actually bad
Clarifying, he has been very irresponsible and unprofessional dealing with serious situations and that is very critic sable. I'm just saying the main focus of the criticism should be over that rather than some unfunny edgy jokes. 
@NotBobbyMcBro Agree completely, he's acted really unprofessional at times, but that should be the main criticism rather than the jokes.
@FridaysOVPyro no one has 'the right' to be angered over jokes
@FridaysOVPyro Yeah he was unprofessional with the EDP situation you can totally criticize him over that. But the main thing people are shitting on him over is the jokes he made
"i mean... was Chet Goldstein really that bad? He made some unfunny edgy jokes so what
he caught EDP that's way more important than making some prank call or a pedo joke lol"

"@commentary_ls @_ThePieman_ yeah i'm not touching grass
at least i can own it"

i was really fucking spergy back in August-November last year, sorry for anyone who had to experience that. At least (I think) I'm moderately bearable now.

I offended enough people with my tweets, might as well go all the way with the bio 
my writing is illegible

@CommentaryLs touching grass 
@_AlexTheLoser_ Pieman#4013
@_AlexTheLoser_ sure
@_AlexTheLoser_ its not personal, I just don't have insta lol
@realitywarrior9 @Mr_Nbody2k nope
"@realitywarrior9 @Mr_Nbody2k lmao
you've gone off the deep end
i'm muting this convo"
@realitywarrior9 @Mr_Nbody2k nah if its used in a non-derogatory way its fine
@_AlexTheLoser_ no
@_AlexTheLoser_ true
@_AlexTheLoser_ it happens with literally any girl on the internet
@_AlexTheLoser_ simps
@realitywarrior9 @Mr_Nbody2k its a joke lol obviously there are more important things
@realitywarrior9 @Mr_Nbody2k nah if you were white i wouldn't have a problem with you calling me the n word in a non-offensive way
"@realitywarrior9 @Mr_Nbody2k i don't ""preach"" about racism against white people much lol
Black people are obviously way more oppressed
But you can just not get offended over the word"
@realitywarrior9 @Mr_Nbody2k you choose whether to be offended or not
"@realitywarrior9 @Mr_Nbody2k the word was used against my family members in an offensive way
if people say it in a non-offensive way what's the problem?"
"@realitywarrior9 @Mr_Nbody2k You do know what I said is literally the definition of racism? You can't argue with facts.
Also yeah I said the n word and they can say it too idc"
@aidinmp3 feminine boys &gt; masculine girls
@_AlexTheLoser_ you can say it if you want my nigga
@realitywarrior9 @Mr_Nbody2k prejudice based on race/ethnicity = racism

@_AlexTheLoser_ edp445 be like: "lilmane told me to do it"
@realitywarrior9 @Mr_Nbody2k jews
@realitywarrior9 @Mr_Nbody2k that sounds like a racist comment
i don't think race is all about color  
@realitywarrior9 @Mr_Nbody2k yeah bro
"@realitywarrior9 @Mr_Nbody2k my dad gets stopped by the cops and airport security all the time
my grandparents literally couldn't vote and were kicked out of their house for the color of their skin
You're not the arbiter of who is black and who is not"
"@realitywarrior9 @Mr_Nbody2k 
Yeah but I come from a coloured family"
@Mr_Nbody2k @realitywarrior9 nah its fine, it's a distinct south african thing so most people dont know about it
"@Mr_Nbody2k @realitywarrior9 half-colored technically

i do no exercise and eat insane amounts of food but i'm still pretty skinny, idk why lol
@TheMomagic yes
All my followers get a full n-word pass
@deaddropfredd @benfivenumbers they're both opinions, just different magnitudes of importance
@deaddropfredd @benfivenumbers I'm not saying it's a good thing that it's political. If it were up to me no one would be racist. However it is an undisputable fact that things like bigotry is a political issue.
@deaddropfredd @benfivenumbers i'm friends with someone who likes pineapple on pizza, doesn't mean i like it
"@realitywarrior9 according to your standards i can not be friends with you
...racist"
"@deaddropfredd @benfivenumbers i mean... it is politics.
I can still be not racist and stuff and not go batshit if one of my friends is. Not everything's politics."
@JohnSwanling link to the site?
@deaddropfredd @benfivenumbers nah i just literally don't care about my friends' politics
@fl3xecutive That's what I thought. Also he clearly never took a break from working on videos lol. He's talking about how he was "touching grass" but I guarantee you he never stopped that yt grind.
he's going PR mode again trying to look "cool" or whatever. If he wants to get his reputation back he should just be himself and not focus so much on doing whatever he can to boost his career
@deaddropfredd @benfivenumbers i'm cool with racists and homophobes, not racism and homophobia
John Swan's trying to do the "le troll" arlus-type tweets but it's just not really funny. He's trying too hard and that sort of persona just seems forced
@Mr_Nbody2k i had two really bright lights to my face when i took the pic lol
"I, a half-black bisexual, have been called a racist and homophobe more times today that I can imagine, not to mention a nazi.
I'm not upset I just find it hilarious."
@deaddropfredd @benfivenumbers your bio is so cringe it reads like satire
@bvbydr1ver yo wanna fuck?
@mschneider2005 i dont think so, but only do something if you're comfortable doing it
@Federalhood i already muted it lol
@Federalhood yeah
ok  
@m00nlithalo i'm mixed race...
I know they're flagging my account but, they do know that the n word is not against the twitter rules right? 
@CythixVibin both of you stop fighting it's just a joke who cares
@CythixVibin damn
i don't remember this henry stickmin game 
@CythixVibin 😧*concern*
"@ginneanvb Nope there's literally no difference, if there is explain it to me.
Also it would help being less condescending in twitter arguments, especially since you're the dumber one here"
@Xqlicit banger
 
"@rosebudmattel @ginneanvb slurs are imaginary
don't like a word, don't get offended by it"
@ginneanvb there's literally no difference
@ginneanvb @rosebudmattel monkeys are smarter than most animals but are way dumber than any human besides ultra-retards
@FQMule its a good opinion
@ginneanvb @rosebudmattel You still can't seem to understand the word 'exclusion' so I think you have the real monkey brain here
"@ginneanvb being ratioed doesn't automatically mean you have a bad take.
A non-racist user with a small following can be ""ratioed"" by a racist user with a large following, doesn't mean the former is in the wrong."
"@Xqlicit nah i'm ugly asf
i'm sure you look great"
@rosebudmattel nope
@FQMule nope
@JohnBrownExp nah if we're buddies it's cool
"@ginneanvb @rosebudmattel i mean someone can be a good person apart from murdering someone
I don't think your brain is developed enough to process the concept of excluding things for hypothetical purposes"
@rosebudmattel you're forgetting the "apart from the racism" bit again...
@DeeeTgg then that's an unrealistic situation. Racists aren't a pokemon who say 'nigger' every 5 seconds
@ginneanvb a ratio means that you are taking the unpopular opinion. I'm glad to be brave enough to express my unpopular thoughts :)
@JohnBrownExp if it doesnt come up in conversation then no
@DeeeTgg racists don't just say the n word every 5 min lol
"@ginneanvb I'm 100% progressive on social issues btw.
Also basic human decency sadly is a political position nowadays whether you like it or not. That's the world we live in."
@FQMule I'm saying apart from the racism they can be a good person
@rosebudmattel nah someone can be a racist and kind in everything else
@kendostix i'm bi
@JohnBrownExp i'm half black
@DeeeTgg "apart" from the racism they can be a good person
@rosebudmattel i'm saying apart from the racism and stuff they can be a good person
@Harrisingle i said "and disagree with them" in the original tweet lol
@DivyanSehgal its not
@Shishkeberry you don't have to
@soolpiah @HarleyTBSYT i mean it is a political issue whether you like it or not
"If you don't talk politics all the time with them (which is kinda normal) then there's barely any difference between them and anyone else.
Also a racist or whatever person can still be a good person in everything else.
Again, not defending their stupid views. "
@HarleyTBSYT i mean if you don't talk politics then what's the problem? it would barely make a difference
@dutchplacehold1 damn got trolled lmao
hot take: you can be friends with a racist/homophobe and still disagree with their views
"@dutchplacehold1 why try to cancel someone over the political opinions of one of their friends?
can you literally not find anything worthwhile against him so you resort to this nonsense?"
@jadeechonn don't shove crazy up your pussy?
I literally don't collab for "networking" or views (even though it does often help), I collab because it's epic working with people i like

@Vampuffin @ZaptieTheBear maybe, idk i'm just quite depressed from living here where i hate it and i'm so lonely that's why i've depended on the commentary community
@ZaptieTheBear @Vampuffin i dont like anyone here anyway and even if i did i wouldn't want an interstate relationship
@Vampuffin i won't edate. I've seen friends do it and it never works out
@ZaptieTheBear @Vampuffin i moved state about a year ago and in ~8 months I'm moving back to live with my grandparents because i hate it so much here so why talk to people if I'm just going anyway.
@Vampuffin its more complicated than that, it's kinda difficult to explain
i always feel like i think people are close friends when they don't feel the same way back
@LtMayhem i mean it says it on wikipedia 
wait so what happened with that ice poseidon 13 year old situation a couple years ago?

@OhMarDayz_ @plate_hog the joke is quite overused by now
@lleah101 @sadlyitssoph_ To be fair, the problem a lot of people have with James is the sheer amount of people he didn't know the age. For Pyro is was one, which is bad but can be excused as a mistake. With James Charles though, there are so many.
Commentary youtubers are just guys who make videos. That's cool, but don't act like they're anything more.

@jakontrary wasn't that theturnz?
@mann_hydra yes
My videos about commentary drama probably won't get much views, so luckily I have videos on Keemstar, Steven Crowder and PewDiePie coming up to actually boost my channel lol
@JohnSwanling I know they're not edgy, but Mindcrack &gt; every other minecraft group
In my experience that's a pattern I've seen a lot of. Which is why I often find it harder to trust those sorts of "clean", "pc" people.
Sometimes the edgiest people are the genuine ones who are honest and nice and the "clean", "pc" people are the snakes who have something to hide, who will do anything for their own benefit.
my goal is to become the largest commentator without any fanart
maybe facecam stream on second channel tomorrow doing youtuber impressions

@Bowblax you already beat him in weight, now you have to beat him in subs
@KrzearYT Well that's not exactly what I mean. I'm more saying there's no reason to get angry at someone over making content you dislike, as people have different tastes in entertainment.
@MediocreCommen1 i don't get angry over not enjoying it, also i'm fine with topic commentary
@Arlus i'm thinking a light to decent 6 
@alfieisntfunny 
"@JohnSwanling @DavidplexTalks Most of it I see is ""you make too much vegan teacher/dream videos"" or ""you make low-effort videos"". Both of which don't really matter.
Yeah effort doesn't make a video good. A funny topic commentary can be just as good if not better as a long video essay."
@JohnSwanling @DavidplexTalks Some is shit criticism (the "too much vegan teacher videos" and "low-effort" criticisms come to mind), but some is valid.
"@JohnSwanling @DavidplexTalks Sometimes criticism is valid. You can't argue with that.

But I do see some people have an irrational hate for topic commentary that may arise from some form of jealousy."
@Jako_LIVE @jakontrary i mean the support following the john swan shit did help me out but i was gaining subs before from my soph video

RT @acidmais : Jake paul can't beat ksi.
Making topic commentary may be an easy ticket to success now, but any second YouTube could patch the bug and you could struggle to retain the same growth.
Like Lets-Plays and Reddit videos, all easy-to-make daily content that gets tons of views eventually is affected by an algorithm change and dies out.

you may not personally enjoy topic commentary, but why get angry at the people who make it?
If you pay attention, there are several sub-communities within the commentary community. The boundaries are quite fuzzy and people obviously regularly interact with people from different sub-communities, but certain groups are noticable.
maybe they'll find out he's not a real doctor
"Turkey Tom (a bird), collabed with Nick, then he was bombarded with hate from Pyro fans.

John Swan (a bird), collabed with Nick, then he got caught in the Dream lie.

@jadeechonn I guess some people consider it cringy. I don't care much either way, but I think its a topic where both sides have some merit.
*bio
I myself can see the point in cis people having pronouns in bio, I'm just annoyed at people who misrepresent others' arguments.
When people complain about pronouns in bio, obviously they know they have pronouns. The argument is usually that cis people don't need to state their pronouns in their bi, not that "no one has pronouns", a complete made up strawman argument.
RT @KFC_ES : 
as soon as I get a maid outfit...
wish i looked like this 
@DeeeTgg nice
if i was an e-girl i would have so many simps
@LuffyzMonkey hi
@InternetUnwind @nicholasdeorio @jamescharles hmm
@CommentaryLs my soph video had a lot of research
its not a commentator
@CommentaryLs that was an opinion video, it didn't need sources lol. I was just talking about what commentary i like
@RaptorIsBased 100%
👀 
@ZoidxFox no lmao
I'm going to have a small feature in a video from a channel you might not expect.
@Ramains_ :)
@Ramains_ @plate_hog @Real_aMac @OhMarDayz_ @HayleyAutumnLad @_ThePieman_ @Niftyylol one day
@DavidplexTalks @zaptiee @plate_hog @DeadMemeFrog I'll collab with you as soon as you upload the turkey tom video
would love it if someone could find a copy of this video by MrMicrowave, which I had a part in 
@Niftyylol yes
Reply tagging someone you would like to collab with one day
@CommentaryLs if that's what you got from my video you must be braindead
@Cythix_ you can have fun with me
@Xqlicit :)
report this sicko to the police 
RT @ebeggin1 : @JustinWhang Evergreen 
@jakontrary no you're not
@lottasin @Lilmaneyt true
@Lilmaneyt @Sub2Michae1
@RyzeonD @ZaptieTheBear that fucking receding hairline
@Lilmaneyt i agree
@Lilmaneyt commentary high school...
Isn't it weird that a lot of us are essentially growing up together in this community
@Lilmaneyt @_AlexTheLoser_ lilmane moment
@Lilmaneyt yes
"RT @_ThePieman_ : It turns out Keemstar wasn't just fucking Hila.

@Leafy do you know about this? "
@Lilmaneyt 85%
@Cythix_ you look like you could be one of my cousins lol
@KlutzyYT_ i can beat him in a few months if I grind hard enough
My goal sub-wise is to beat this imposter 
@OhMarDayz_ idk who any apart from arlus are
@DemonAngelJason @jakontrary can't believe he would be racist🤬🤬🤬 
RT @OhMarDayz_ : bruh im not far from hitting 800 lol 
@BdankYT @LuffyzMonkey 
Using your young age or small follower account to claim you're being harassed is just a deflection of criticism
@LuffyzMonkey @BdankYT i got something to ask u
@PunishedDef @Taps77w finally, today is my day
@jakontrary depends, there may be a situation where it is necessary
@JohnSwanling @DavidplexTalks I meant that I hold everyone to the same standard when I criticize them
@JohnSwanling @DavidplexTalks I hold you, Pancho and any other youtuber to the same standard
@JohnSwanling @DavidplexTalks first one is in quotes so he's quoting the person in the video, idk if morgz did respond but if morgz didn't, then pancho shouldn't have lied.
"@JohnSwanling @DavidplexTalks lying is not exaggeration
you said something that was not true, you didn't make something appear more important or greater than it is"
RT @jakontrary : 
"@mschneider2005 Sperging ≠ venting
that's what this is account is for, it's fine"
@RyzeonD yeah I barely talk about Toxix because he's only does what he does for people to get upset. Like I thought from LITERALLY the second I met him in June last year, he's just a troll.
@HarleyTBSYT it depends on the situation. A smack on the butt if you don't clean your room is different from constant physical abuse
@jakontrary sadly he deleted he best one
@FastingVynx I agree but the way you said it didn't make it clear it was a joke
@FastingVynx I still disapprove of homophobic/transphobic comments like this post however. I just won't dislike someone I like or "kick" someone out of my community just because of it
@blaretelevision I do agree it doesn't look the best
"""i don't want transphobic people in my community""

why? they're still gonna be transphobes whether they're in your community or not, all that does is make your audience smaller"
like, its just people on the internet why should i care if some opinions they have are stupid?
i'm not transphobic/homophobic/bigoted myself but i honestly couldn't give a shit about whether my fans or the people i like are.
@iMARQ6 no, poor lighting
@dutchplacehold1 @alfieisntfunny Yes and the Eastern Orthodox Church is incredibly influential and is the official religion of Russia.
@alfieisntfunny this is why the map of countries where homosexuality is criminalized is mostly made up of Muslim-majority countries, as most Muslims in Muslim countries are quite radical (Muslims living in western countries are usually moderates) 
"@alfieisntfunny People who take the Bible or Quran literally are homophobes because both those ""holy books"" are homophobic.
That doesn't excuse them of course, I'm just saying the religion itself is the cause for this and its another reason why religion is retarded"
"RT @_ThePieman_ : It seems somebody wants stricter harassment policies huh...
Now remember again, how did that turn out for other sites which have tightened those sorts of rules such as YouTube? "
"@GayAreZee Because he puts in long clips of other people's videos and explains things in great detail yeah.
But no seriously TheGamerFromMars is known for how in-depth his research is. Watch his Bashurverse documentary and tell me you disagree lol"
@Krazzf shut up
@GayAreZee Also I'd say TheGamerFromMars is the best researcher in the community
@GayAreZee I didn't say research is everything.
My editing may be shit but I put A LOT of effort into my research and it pays off
commentary channels need to put more focus on their research
@Scrimzox_ @sadlyitssoph_ where does she say that
send me links to discord servers i should join
@HayleyAutumnLad i guess maybe, I mean I reply to your tweets sometimes
@Mr_Nbody2k big gaming youtuber
woah just found out about what happened with cryaotic last year
@_AlexTheLoser_ you're even more cool :)
@Niftyylol its cringe
@vorzai never
@JohnSwanling exactly

Scarce is the original commentary nice guy
i automatically respect someone more if they don't have and never had a tiktok account
@Arlus are there actually any pyro fans who don't know he's said it?
@_AlexTheLoser_ as someone's who's often the oldest, being youngest is way better
whenever he's on trending i just assume he's dead lol 
@DavidplexTalks a true supreme gentleman gets the girl
@_AlexTheLoser_ I MEAN WHO HOLDS HANDS LIKE #8
@_AlexTheLoser_ some of these are completely made up i swear wtf
@DavidplexTalks simp
@Mr_Nbody2k no

@fl3xecutive @_ThePieman_ @Neoncaffeine my editing is NOT good lmao
@Lilmaneyt me too, its one of my biggest regrets. I wanted to but sadly my parents didn't allow me to
@jadeechonn you're chill and I like seeing your tweets on the timeline. Also you make pretty good art (not the best but its good)
@ItsDrDemonic I'm way too high up imo but thanks
@CablZone @sadlyitssoph_ 
@sadlyitssoph_ Because misgendering is offensive if it invalidates what you identify as. Cythix's tweet doesn't because it doesn't challenge your gender identity.
@sadlyitssoph_ The reason trans people get offended (justifiably) is because people actually insist unironically they are a gender they don't identify as
"@sadlyitssoph_ he was joking
Also everyone knows you're a girl, no one thinks you aren't so I don't see what's so bad about this."
i mean she's clearly a girl and everyone knows it, Cythix doesn't actually think she's a boy
"Context:
"
"As I said before:
there's a difference between using wrong pronouns to actually say unironically ""you are this gender you don't identify as"" and jokingly saying you're a guy as a meme "
@sadlyitssoph_ @Cythix_ @sinfullymyself @jadeechonn there's a difference between using wrong pronouns to actually say unironically "you are this gender yu don't identify as" and jokingly saying you're a different gender as a meme
@sadlyitssoph_ @Cythix_ @sinfullymyself @jadeechonn he just made a joke lol stop getting offended
@lottasin smol booba better
@alfieisntfunny you are being pretty annoying
@Kxduss coming from someone who doesn't even like Jadyn, you're a massive dumbass
@zeriosii what
RT @WackyBruhTV : New video gamers 
@ItsBunaye I'm just not the guy to say "hey man, you're gonna break up eventually". Especially when both are friends.
@ItsBunaye i don't say much because some of my friends e-date and i do honestly want their relationships to work out, even though I know it won't in the end
@ItsBunaye e-dating moment
@Cythix_ i dmd him on discord
@Cythix_ he's right. Remove the Lt
@lottasin making videos
@Distronical 6 other creators. I've researched it all already, I've already scripted my own part and I'm halfway done editing my part (editing takes me the longest anyway)
@Distronical I'm researching/writing the whole thing but I've got a bunch of great creators to edit different parts.
@jakontrary i think you meant to DM this to nick deorio?
@Sub2Michae1 tbf i never criticised TRO about the length of his videos
@jadeechonn Good, but a little tired. How about you?
@jadeechonn good morning
don't worry i have some amazing people helping to edit sections so it wont take too long 
@GayAreZee I'm editing my part (~40 min) first, which I'm almost done. Then I need to write the rest (I'm really quick at scripting so this wont take long) and split the audio file into ~15 min sections for people to edit.
iceberg video part 1 probably going to be 2-3 hours long
@Mr_Nbody2k no
editing is so boring i hate it
"RT @MorePieman : @Memeulous

@TrollFaceDaddy He speaks in monotone. It would be less annoying if he didn't speak like a robot.
@VleasoTV you'll succeed one day
the best feeling in the world is seeing friends succeed
i'm not even talking about from trolls, i meant from his own fans

"@blaretelevision nerd city's looks fire

Also, anyone who said onions can burn in hell."

honestly this iceberg video is gonna be my best yet, i'm really excited for it to be completed
@_AlexTheLoser_ lmao the fact that you had to write this tweet
@zeriosii pics or video relating to the topic you're discussing
@Slasher83436868 he's just a bit edgy. I'm part hispanic and part black and idgaf what he says
@ItsBunaye sure
"@Slasher83436868 ltcobra's trolling is funny, i don't see a problem with that

@Slasher83436868 why may i ask?
@Slasher83436868 i like both of them, content and person

@OhMarDayz_ @jadeechonn true

"i would never make an OC or use gameplay footage in my videos
idc if others do but its not for me"
@dutchplacehold1 @HarleyTBSYT ok i don't see how harley's thumbnails are sexualizing himself LMAO wtf are you seeing lol
"@HarleyTBSYT @dutchplacehold1 I agree with every single thing you just said. I never excused ANYTHING those degens did. I just said that factually, it might be helpful to not make those jokes, but you do whatever you want to do.
We're going in circles at this point so imma stop arguing"
@HarleyTBSYT @dutchplacehold1 I'm not excusing anything and what they did is 100% wrong. But the reality is (sadly) that making less of those jokes may prevent some of this from happening.
i literally cant understand why some people hate kids
@zeriosii i follow you and saw you on the timeline
@zeriosii i'm a tiny youtuber with only 1k subs lol idk why you treat it as a big deal but I'm flattered you're a fan.
@HarleyTBSYT I guess I see where you're coming from. I wasn't making excuses for the degens or anything I was just saying that it might help if you didn't make those sort of jokes.
@HarleyTBSYT I know, but I'm just saying idk if this is encouraging that sort of behaviour
@Xqlicit you are doing what's right. Ignore the idiots.
@Vampuffin most of my simping is ironic anyway lol
@Vampuffin cant help it if the boys in this community are so damn hot

"Saying it again publicly because some people keep asking, I'm bi.
But because I'm only attracted to feminine people (boys and girls) and I'm only romantically attracted to females, sometimes I just call myself straight to make things easier."

@calypso_live @lottasin anytime a woman posts a selfie there are 100 small commentators all replying to her simping

@GayAreZee that is what i mean, and it wouldn't be for a while anyway
"@GayAreZee if you could I would love for you to do a section, your editing is fantastic
(also I can help you with your scripting for your own videos as you said you had problems with scripting)"
I have some ideas of people I would like to work with but I would be open to others offering to help (if I like their content or them)
"I'm thinking about getting some people to collab on my iceberg video via them editing portions. It would fix the problem of my mediocre editing and my script and narration would stay + it would help get the video out earlier.

@acidmais thats a higher percentage of females than usual for a commentary channel from what i've seen of other's stats
@Mr_Nbody2k @GayAreZee nope
@Krazzf oh lmao i thought it was another sin and pieman joke
@VleasoTV @GayAreZee then make a video
@Krazzf is this a joke about me or...

@Real_aMac ok
RT @DocOnTheRadio : @MorePieman There are commentators in the commentary community 
@DeeeTgg @GayAreZee so would i be a big commentator?
@Krazzf @Cythix_ tbf this is you 
RT @acidmais : @MorePieman there's gotta be a balance of both. If ur making videos you hate SOLELY for money and views then whats the point in having this "dream job". If u can make videos you like (whether they're the best they can be or not doesnt matter) while also getting views and money then W
@acidmais Yeah obviously its good to get money and views and stuff. But solely doing whatever you can for more views, ignoring everything else, will leave you tired of making stuff you don't like
"A big point I made in my latest video is that making videos for money/views instead of because you enjoy making them is not the best motivator and it's not healthy.
I think my point has been proven."
@Krazzf @Cythix_ @ZoidxFox yeah cythix is a bit too overly sexual

@lottasin i agree, people who flip-flop to get on the "popular side" once someone mentions mental health are idiots
@VleasoTV really? so augie was a small commentator only a few months ago?
Honestly wondering, how much subs do you think you would need to no longer be considered a "small commentator"? I would guess ~10k

@sadlyitssoph_ that makes it better, go out with him

"lol people are simping over him when almost all of his face is covered up and its black and white
at least simp for someone who you've seen their face before "
@sadlyitssoph_ go out with him
i wonder if these youtubers defending jadyn actually looked at what people were criticising him for or just saw  jadyn's rage tweets
"RT @Commentary_OOC : this is going to be the tweet that makes me follow pieman

@Krazzf @Cythix_ i would retweet that to get it to 10k
RT @Arlus : 
lmao I'm not gonna talk about the drama anymore but its interesting how Jadyn changed the story to "people are criticizing me for being unoriginal/low-effort" when people were only criticizing him for clickbaiting youtuber deaths and being bad at taking criticism.
@Mr_Nbody2k @_AlexTheLoser_ idk ask my parents lol I don't understand it either
@_AlexTheLoser_ Yeah I understand how you feel. In September my parents found out I had socials (which I wasn't allowed) and I was off Twitter/Discord for over a month.

kids are so fat nowadays like goddamn lose some weight
I replaced it with women and I don't see the problem... 
@jadeechonn aren't they?
@KNO1234554321 @tatspvt lmao hopefully not completely
@Sub2Michae1 love you too
@jadeechonn as long as I can start some pointless drama later on
@jadeechonn can't wait to charge $2000 for requests
drew my profile picture lmao 
When I talk to someone about alternate history and they bring up Operation Sealion - I know they're too stupid to talk to
@quxkcity oof 
I seem to have upset some Dream stans with this one... 
also Dream #YangGang so based 
Who the fuck cares? 
@Lilmaneyt leafy made terrible videos
ironically, degenerate mcyt stans probably just go to @McytAverages to look at weird fanfics
@TheRealGrantma A lot of small commentators change their voice to make it sound deeper. It's always very obvious.
I can tell when a youtuber changes their voice for recording and I prefer it when they use their normal voice.
@Neoncaffeine I think its the cosplay? I was just blocked recently
"i don't have youtuber role in like any discord servers lol
not complaining, I barely go in other youtubers' servers, I just find it interesting"
@realExate Yeah I don't like him as a person but his content is fairly entertaining.
I like Dream's content
was it the cosplay in my profile pic?
I don't even know why lol

what's one opinion you have about the age of consent that makes everyone do this? 
@_AlexTheLoser_ 👍
@Cythix_ @_ThePieman_ I don't care about your culture. Just don't do it.
@Cythix_ @_ThePieman_ Just don't do it at all. At age 15, it can seriously fuck up your brain. There are tons of medical studies on smoking weed during puberty, it really fucks your brain up.
@Cythix_ @_ThePieman_ weed can be (almost) just as bad
@Mr_Nbody2k @Cythix_ @_ThePieman_ yes
@Cythix_ @_ThePieman_ I will never smoke, drink alcohol or do any drugs so sorry mate.
goodnight

while view-wise my video's doing quite well, it hasn't translated into subs, probably because the video hasn't been seen by much outside my subscriber base.

@ZaptieTheBear thank you for telling me this

@realExate I just think the tweet's funny
"@JohnSwanling @BasedAreZee that has nothing to do with what i said lmao

I'm saying your videos aren't informative at all"
@realExate he says "cancel culture" is the reason he can't be funny
@JohnSwanling @BasedAreZee informative lmao the next vsauce right here folks
@Real_SolarYT i haven't seen the movie and I don't plan to, but I do see similarities with the plot
now that my videos done, onto making the iceberg video


@Commentary_OOC yeah i was copying a Michae1 copypasta
"@GooseGary2 I've had that editing take for a long time.
I went after Skipper because I legitimately believe he was in the wrong. I will NOT argue about it now but that was something I firmly believe I had the right to call out, no matter if he's seen as the ""nice guy"" of the community."
@GooseGary2 lol I don't care about this account
@GooseGary2 Name one thing I've just "gone against the popular opinion" for for the sake of contrarianism. E.g. in a tier list from last year November I put TRO in C, all my opinions are my own.
@GooseGary2 I think I've been putting more based takes out now than ever before. But, agree to disagree.
@GooseGary2 then why do you follow me?
@OhMarPriv @Bowblax 
"@Arlus someone who ratios someone else gets more likes than the original tweet, so that opinion is more popular. Being ratioed therefore means you have the unpopular opinion.
I'm saying that if you get ratioed, that means you are brave enough to take the unpopular stance"

@BasedAreZee i think he's trying to justify how unfunny he is
flashback to when jaydn said he's not funny because "cancel culture" 
RT @jakontrary : @MorePieman ratio
"chasing that bag" 
If you get upset over being ratioed, that means you're upset you don't hold the opinion of the majority. Being ratioed means you're courageous.
@BasedAreZee @_ThePieman_ say it
@Woody7803 @jakontrary That's why i'm saying APART from if you're trying to get a job, no normal person cares
@DeeeTgg @jakontrary first one literally strawmanned my argument and the second one was funny, I don't have a problem with that ratioing me lmao
@ZaptieTheBear @jakontrary come here @jakontrary lets get this over with
@DeeeTgg @jakontrary 
@jakontrary 
@jakontrary I'm not about resumes or shit, I'm saying regular people you're not looking to hire you don't care
@jakontrary 
@Commentary_OOC i am now curious as to what they were
@harrisingle I do try to speak my mind, even if I disagree with most people.
@harrisingle i dont see it

@CythixYouTube @BasedAreZee Well always remember that no matter who shits on you, the people who care about you listen to you and know how great of a person you are
@GooseGary2 i think topic commentators and video essayists should stop fighting each other and just make entertaining content
There are many things to criticize topic commentators on, but the two most often said are simultaneously the weakest; making tons of videos on the same people and being "low-effort"
in 2019 every video essayist commentator made a Slazo video, so I don't think they can accuse topic commentators each making essentially the same videos on That Vegan Teacher of being "unoriginal"
"I can sort of understand why Dream feels so protective of his stans in a sense (even though I still disagree with him on it). 
It would be something really strange but comforting for millions of people to care so deeply about you and I think Dream has got sucked into this."
@tatymaty_ i ship it
@Real_aMac i feel sick
@tatymaty_ ...what
@FarAwayPhantom that's why I said "just"
@2__roman Good editing can make a good video great but can't make a bad video good. That's my view
50 year olds preying on 16-17 year olds aren't just "creeps" or "perverts", they're PEDOPHILES
@DrDre4mTV Yeah I was kinda talking about people who solely judge videos off how good their editing is, ignoring al other factors.
cars 2 is unironically one of my favourite pixar movies
"@DrDre4mTV Topic commentary is not usually scripted.
A video essay can be perfectly fine with just normal cuts instead of super over-the-top transitions and hundreds of hours in after effects."
@aidinmp3 @_ThePieman_ that is literally my least favourite movie
new keemstar profile pic 
tbh if i was a woman I would probably end up being a thot, they make hella money
@crimtia 
(kyle and krystal are great, i'm poking fun at shoe's flipflopping)
ironic 
@GooseGary2 @jakontrary Exactly, that's my point
@alsike_xiv Someone mad I called daddy TRO bad😢
@jakontrary Many videos don't need good editing. E.g. Mutahar, diesel, cr1tikal
@GooseGary2 I agree but you can have a good video without good editing.
@OhMarPriv @jadeechonn i was talking about cartoon characters from shows
@DeeeTgg Genuine. I dislike his content.
Friendly reminder: Editing isn't actually that important for a good video.
@alsike_xiv Nope! Criticize me on my editing all you want but my writing was well done for that video and I stand by that. There was no filler apart from some jokes I threw in which added some humor.
@alsike_xiv This is the problem with lots of you editors, you think editing is the most important thing. Nope! Writing is.
"@alsike_xiv ""Powerpoint presentation"" huh? I know what you're talking about now, editing!
Editing isn't the most important thing lmao. A good video essay doesn't need super-high effort editing to be good. In fact my favourite video essayists (Turkey Tom and EmpLemon) don't have 10/10 editing"
@alsike_xiv I know you're quite literally on the payroll but you don't have to simp this hard lmao
"@alsike_xiv I didn't make it double the length it needed to be, everything I said in the video was needed to fully complete the narrative.
TRO videos drag on for hours repeating other people's research and being so boring no one can stay interested without doing something else."
@alsike_xiv I watch his videos and they are incredibly boring and badly-paced. I don't think what I said in my video was filler and also it is very interesting to me that most people say they like TRO's videos the best when they're not actually paying attention to it🤔
@alsike_xiv 
@alsike_xiv I disagree, it all added something. At least I didn't make a video where half of it is me playing someone else's video and making a comment every 5 minutes.
@_greenhaven_ @alsike_xiv i dont understand the joke
RT @MorePieman : 
@alsike_xiv Disagree. TRO has good research and editing but his pacing is downright terrible and it leads his videos to be absolutely painful to sit through.
@alsike_xiv i had better writing and pacing than any of TRO's vids
RT @Real_aMac : Happy good friday
@ZaptieTheBear probably made in august
Emplemon videos tier list (the tier list only had his vids up to August last year for some reason) 
@jadeechonn I guess as background noise it makes sense. I like to watch videos with my full attention and I just can't finish a TRO vid.
@CythixYouTube yes

@jadeechonn that's fine, I'm more talking about characters from shows and such
@Krazzf @Real_aMac you dont get in by clearly begging for it
commentators stop using cartoon characters as profile pics challenge
@Krazzf its just reading one quote, so not a big feature like i said
cant believe i just got a (small) feature in the next video of one of my favourite history youtubers
I remember one of his videos played like 20 minute clips of someone else's videos in it with TRO just making a little comment summarizing what was just shown every 5 minutes
"his (i mean his editors') editing is great
his research is pretty good
but the writing is bad and the pacing is downright terrible"
@harrisingle no, too much exposition, not enough analysis
TRO is the most overrated commentator. idk how anyone can sit through his boring-ass videos
how are people still offended over 9/11 jokes, it happened 20 years ago, we're way past the point of "too soon"

I don't think this is any evidence Wikipedia is "sexist" or anything.
This seems less to do with current oppression of women and more to do with historical oppression of women. There are not as much Wikipedia pages about women because women were often kept out of professions in science, politics and sports. 
@TDPSBtv yeah i was that kid in 2018, always saying memes out loud to try and be funny
@BdankYT yeah you got me, but still I think there are very few exceptions to jokes

@calypso_live @lottasin oh 
@BdankYT I guess all jokes are okay unless they physically directly harm people or threaten people with harm in an unjoking way.
@calypso_live @lottasin what is dapping up and why do you want to do it to sin
@BdankYT if its not clear enough then it shouldn't be made
"RT @MorePieman : Documentary commentary = Retelling of an event or series of events, exposition + often analysis

@AckJigglen 🤐
@AckJigglen @Ramains_ i know what you said lmao
@AckJigglen @Ramains_ what
@Neoncaffeine Yeah, but I see people defending him saying he was just saying they're as bad as each other. But he consumes one anyway...
I'm confused on the Vaush CP argument. I get he's saying you can't be ok with buying things profiting off child labor AND be against cp, but since he does purchase things made using child labor, isn't be saying they're both ok?


RT @manipulatorgod : no offense if i was dating a commentary youtuber i would quite literally bl*w my fucking brains out

@aidinmp3 Yeah we need to make sure its not faked DMs
@Ramains_ All good bro, you're into what you're into! But tbh it is funny lol
face reveal 
Cancel culture strikes again. As a massive stan of Hitler, I can tell you this was clipped out of context from one of his streams. He was using pedophilia tactically to compare against how our culture justifies child labor. 
@twit_breezy @TheRealBlaxx cringe
Probably I'll make the iceberg video (although later on). Quite a few things on Skipper's video (e.g. the Idubbbz's real name entry) missed some stuff.
If you back down from arguing for something you genuinely believe is right for the chance of a shoutout or some subs, you didn't really believe in it in the first place.
A common misconception is that Leafy was banned for his Pokimane videos. He was banned after he had a Surreal Animations video which had a disturbing animation of h3h3 as his outro.
"why does every drama i get into have to be against someone respected lmao
just my luck"
at least i can start recording tomorrow
@DeeeTgg I know, I'm just saying I'm not gonna leave the internet
@DeeeTgg No lmao I'm not gonna leave the internet like some bitch who just lost an internet argument
idk if I'm even gonna make the video anymore, no matter how much effort I already put in so far. While I stand by everything I've said, this has just been mentally draining and I've gotten quite emotional from this.
@GooseGary2 i definitely won't lmao
@gayplant101 @DoktorSkippy It's not a coincidence. It's clearly a joke which makes use of plausible deniability
@gamertrash14YT @DoktorSkippy lmao i'm not an idiot
@DoktorSkippy very funny.
@KrzearYT Because I'm right.
"lol at people who think that I'll ""take the L"" because some crappy-medium sized topic commentators called me out over me calling out a bigger creator.

learn from last time"
@radmaniiac @Lilmaneyt i called him out lmao why do people overuse the word "cancelled" so much?
right again! 
RT @avethefirst : 
@GayAreZee Agreed. People forget about him since he isn't in the commentary community.
@OhMarPriv @sinfullymyself @ZaptieTheBear @alsike_xiv i thought so too.

@VleasoTV hi! *definitely is not trying to get clout*
@GayAreZee no comment
@VleasoTV @GooseGary2 why respond to a shit tweet like that
@GooseGary2 @VleasoTV im saying basically every tweet they are the first reply, not adding anything
@VleasoTV Yeah the people who are always one of the first replies to any big youtuber tweet, usually their reply is less than 6 words long as well, adding nothing
@VleasoTV Think about the people who reply "hi" to a youtuber posting "good morning" every single time. Those leeches annoy me (even though some of them are my friends).
@VleasoTV I have not
once you pay attention, you realize why some commentary channels have tons more followers than subscribers

It may work, but I know what you're doing"

"@fl3xecutive Australia basically just consumes American media so its about the same.
I do think the right fuels racism a lot, but I don't think criticizing China is a way in which it's happening."
"@fl3xecutive Yeah, if they can't tell the difference between China and Chinese people, you can't really control that.
I don't think its most Republicans however, more like a loud minority"
"@fl3xecutive I'm not rightwing, but I think the recent backlash against China is well-deserved. China is by far the worst country in the world at the moment and until now, they have gotten almost no criticism. That's not racist
Its like you can't say people criticizing Israel are anti-Semitic"
"@fl3xecutive Trump never said chinese people are the cause of the virus, he said China is. Him calling covid the ""chinese virus"" is not an issue because tons of other viruses have the name of where they came from in it.
Perhaps he could clarify better that he doesn't mean chinese people."
"@fl3xecutive Viruses have historically been named after the place of origin, it isn't racist. Spanish Flu, Ebola, Zika, etc.
Also China ≠ chinese people"
*cough*pyro*cough*
@fl3xecutive China is heavily responsible for allowing the coronavirus to spread and I don't think calling covid the "china virus" is racist (even though I don't call it that), but blaming random asian people is just stupid and makes no sense
i like you harley but i'm not too sure about this one bud

@JohnSwanling I agree it's unfair, I agree. I'm just saying YouTube says it doesn't punish creators for off-site behavior.
@JohnSwanling YouTube (at least apart from Onision and Crowder) applies punishments for rules broken on the platform. According to YouTube Leafy broke rules on YouTube whereas MiniLadd never broke rules on-platform.
@tatymaty_ How well they deal with criticism is irrelevant to the quality of their content.
@DoktorSkippy The best idea is to have some sort of a balance imo
@tatymaty_ I disagree. Done well, gameplay commentators can be way better than analytical or essayist commentators. It's all in the personality and effort at humor.
@JohnSwanling @acidmais No one is saying that. People are criticizing aspects of his content. I personally enjoy Maison's content, but people do have legitimate critiques.
@JohnSwanling @acidmais I agree, but giving reasons why someone's content is terrible is criticism. No one just says "ur content's shit".
@CythixYouTube @TheRealNoxlish @jadeechonn @StackziesYT ...
@acidmais that's not an argument, who cares if you make money off it that's not what people are criticising you for

@alfieisntfunny I mean my content could use improving and I want to try and make a name for myself outside of this drama, based off the merits of my videos. While I appreciate it, I didn't ask for the shoutouts and such, it just kind of happened, like how most people gain subs during drama.

@lleah101 I love doing accent impressions. I guess if you do it in a really stereotypical insulting way it could be a bit offensive?
@VleasoTV @Holy_childd yes

@Sub2Michae1 What happened?
@Neoncaffeine @alfieisntfunny I think what Alfie's trying to say is he believes John is joking so much about the situation that he doesn't seem to take what he did seriously.
@LtCythixYouTube Which is what I've been saying the whole time. This shit should have been handled in DMs from the start.
@plate_hog true
@DeadMemeFrog @lottasin damn
@Toastify_ arc? i've always been an incel
if i had a real life friend of course lol
Some of the friends I've made in this community have been the closest friends I've ever had. So I treat my friends online just as I would a real life friend.
@GayAreZee 
basically sex with a clone 
@ZaptieTheBear @Real_aMac am0gus
@Ramflipsful I had a similar experience and I'm so glad you've met people that make you happy. Often people focus on the negative aspects of the community but it can really be a positive place to find friends.

effort ≠ quality
@5yb3r @Lilmaneyt But they do try to be entertaining. Try is the word here. I mean Jadyn literally told me he can't be funny in his videos because of "cancel culture".
"@5yb3r @Lilmaneyt No, because he tries to be entertaining and funny. I have spoken with topic commentators who have told me they know they make bad content, but it gets views. They purposefully make bad content.
Also adding ""durr"" to the end of your tweet just makes you look like a retard"
@5yb3r @Lilmaneyt Subjective things are worth discussing. All art is subjective but critical analysis exists.
@5yb3r @Lilmaneyt I'm not talking about effort, I'm talking about quality. They are not the same. A video with no effort can still have quality.
@5yb3r @Lilmaneyt also "you're just jealous" is a pretty shitty argument
@5yb3r @Lilmaneyt I'm not jealous lol, in fact I don't care if the video has 0 effort put into it. I like Mutahar, Optimus, Diesel and 2017 Pyro.
@5yb3r @Lilmaneyt I don't care about it being low quality, I like low quality stuff, I have a problem with them doing stuff ONLY for views.
@Lilmaneyt A topic commentator is usually a commentary channel which discusses a topic (not reacting to a video), usually over gameplay footage. The usually unscripted video consists of explaining the topic of the video and then giving their own opinion.
@5yb3r @Lilmaneyt No, because I've seen many topic commentators make that argument. I've seen discussions around this, I know what he means.
right now i mean
@5yb3r @Lilmaneyt He was. No one says make videos that don't get views, that's a strawman argument. People say "don't JUST care about views", which seems to be the argument lilmane is responding to.
@Lilmaneyt All art is subjective, it doesn't mean it can't be criticized. The Emoji Movie could be someone's favorite movie and their opinion is valid, but people can still have a discussion about the quality of it.
"@Lilmaneyt There can be a balance. It's not like you can either make bad videos that get views or good videos that get none.
You can make good videos that get views."
@Krazzf @Lilmaneyt Yes, and make good content that you and your audience enjoy
@Lilmaneyt I'm fine with people making things on a certain topic constantly, I do however have a problem with them making bad videos (which they admit to) and not caring about it since they'll get money no matter what.
@WisdomSalmon @SlushTV_ @thekinocorner to fight with imallexx while james marriott gets more and more uncomfortable and inabber probably gets dragged into the whole thing with him being kicked out of the eboys

@LtCythix_ @JohnSwanling editing doesnt matter as much with facecam videos. He's incredibly boring and unfunny
@LtCythix_ @Lilmaneyt he's like 15 and most of the drama is stuff from when he was 13/14, it is really so bad that stuff he did at that age is too bad to forgive?
@LtCythix_ @JohnSwanling no, just no. His videos are terrible, by far the worst of the eboys
@LtCythix_ @Lilmaneyt idk why people dislike him so much, he seems fine to me
@LtCythix_ there's not enough good facecam commentators imo

uhh... 
@AkameSpirit @rythril @Sub2Michae1 BriZ is definitely a great commentator
@rythril @Sub2Michae1 My favorite topic commentators are 2016 Pyro, and I guess present day Mutahar. You can tell with both of them they have a feeling of sincerity that is missing from many (not all) topic commentators today.
"@rythril @Sub2Michae1 I don't even think topic commentators need to ""innovate"", they just need to:
1. Don't pretend to care about things they don't care about
2. Actually be funny and entertaining, add some jokes
3. Be themselves (I know its cliche, but so many put on a fake persona)"

"""my audience respects me and i get views, what's the problem?""

""morgz makes bad content, he bad"""
Many topic commentators say that if they are popular and respected by their large fanbase that's all that counts, yet continuously criticize other channels with even larger fanbases which respect them.
@Sub2Michae1 Totally agree, the problem is that a lot of what is getting ppular now is not good topic commentary.

@KrzearYT 
@KrzearYT Wouldn't really call you a topic commentator at this point, I'm more meaning the guys who make a hundred vegan teacher videos that all have the same point: "vegan teacher bad", without adding anything to the conversation
"Also I'd be happy to talk to a topic commentator on the Drama Time podcast this weekend because I'm honestly wondering how they can defend their content.
Most times they don't even defend the quality but say ""well it gets views"", no shit, that's not an excuse for the quality tho."
I'm usually someone who enjoys all types of commentary, from reaction to analytical to facecam, but the stale, absolutely terrible topic commentary that has gained prominence in the last ~3 months is really the worst commentary I have ever seen.

@FarAwayPhantom I agree
@cyclonelmao raintism above turkey tom and nick deorio
@EthanCKelly It's a struggle we all go through😔
From my guess the style of blunt commentary popular in the community is probably more popular with males than females, its not a sexism thing, its just that different genders usually have different interests. Probably that's why most female commentators are somewhat tomboys.
I do sometimes wonder what makes the commentary community so white and more specifically male-oriented. I'm not gonna go into SJW shit but it does make me think about how our community's culture has made it this way.
I'm not usually the most "empathetic" person but I truly can get upset if my friends are. I always want to be a good friend and make sure they're happy.

@Nythiix_ @aidinmp3 @GayAreZee If you want to know why you guys dating is so obvious, Its the quantity and frequency of jokes, the way you joke (simping jokes are wanting someone to be your gf, you joke as if she is already your gf and she responds that way) and how much you like 'complimenting her boyfriend'.
@ZoidxFox @citsira @AckJigglen i dont get it
@Nythiix_ @aidinmp3 @GayAreZee @lottasin @RadManiiac @shoe0nhead idk and idc who that is. All I'm saying is that the way you act, it couldn't be more clear to everyone and you're not doing a very good job hiding the "secret".

@_Davidplex You can have a basic understanding of religion without getting As or even spending so much time working on it. Art is not important for depicting historical events lol I'm a history nerd and art is meaningless.
@_Davidplex Grades don't count as much. Maths, Science and English grades count more when adjusted, also, getting As in Religion or Art won't help you at all in anything.
@_Davidplex no lmao they dont

@LtCythix_ What are you, scared?
@CringeInfluence Good. But as I said earlier, make a very unpopular video once in a while, it'll make you seem like you actually believe in your opinions.
@CringeInfluence So you can make a video stating your true opinions on Dream then?
@CringeInfluence So you're saying you should wait until you have the facts to make an opinion? Sounds like what you should be doing for any topic.
@CringeInfluence Nah just call him out when he does something wrong, its not hard.
@CringeInfluence I don't think so, Dream can be right in one situation and wrong in another. Nuance exists and if your audience is too dumb to understand, you need a better audience.
"@CringeInfluence 1. That's not even that unpopular
2. You can say it"
@CringeInfluence So you're saying you NEVER disagree with any widely popular opinions?
@CringeInfluence I'm not saying that you should defend her, I was just using that as an example to say that once in a while, you should have an opinion that is way different to every other commentator, because naturally people have different opinions so it would happen once in a while.
@CringeInfluence Honestly I would like to see an unpopular opinion for once, like someone defending the Vegan Teacher or whatever when everyone is attacking her or someone attacking a beloved creator when no one else is. If I want someone's opinion on a topic, I want an interesting opinion.
@CringeInfluence But why give your opinion if your opinion is the same as anyone else.
@CringeInfluence Your content is not informative if you regurgitate every larger channel's opinion out of fear of cancellation.
@CringeInfluence All of them changed and all of them are still not stale as fuck and unfunny, unlike you. Or maybe you just need an excuse to explain why your personality is so boring.
"@CringeInfluence You can be monetized and not be stale as fuck. 
You can be monetized and not be stale as fuck. 
You can be monetized and not be stale as fuck. 

How many times do I have to repeat this?"
"@CringeInfluence You don't have to swear to be funny (or edgy)
You can be funny and disagree with people as well as stay monetized
You won't get banned unless you're really edgy
You're the biggest fucking cuck on the platform"
@Commentary_OOC @LtCythix_ is he wrong though?
@CringeInfluence Don't give in anything. The "younger generation" isn't less edgy. 12 year olds spam george floyd memes in discord servers all the time. In fact the most sensitive people are the 16 year old pan non-binary shits who are older than your audience.
@LtCythix_ @CringeInfluence He's just saying he has to be unfunny and stale because "cancel culture" and I'm telling him that's stupid.
@CringeInfluence Then say it with the neopronouns shit. And be actually funny (you don't even have to be edgy to be funny) and say 'touch grass' if people get offended.
@CringeInfluence That is the opposite of what you said before. You complained about getting a tiny backlash for the MatPat video and you said you don't want to offend anyone because "muh cancel culture".
@CringeInfluence But it got 24k likes. So who cares? The whole point of expressing an opinion is that someone will disagree.
@CringeInfluence Your videos are NOT informative, its regurgitating the same opinions held by larger reaction channels which 99.9% of people agree with out of fear that someone will disagree. If you automatically take the popular side with every issue, why watch your content to be "informed"?
RT @MorePieman : @CringeInfluence You're acting like if you aren't an extremely stale creator who is unfunny (like you are), 'cancel culture' will delete your channel. Grow up.
@CringeInfluence You're acting like if you aren't an extremely stale creator who is unfunny (like you are), 'cancel culture' will delete your channel. Grow up.
@CringeInfluence You can keep your career and say stuff that is slightly controversial.
@CringeInfluence You will keep your career if you said the n word, you just have to not care about it. You make your fans, your fans don't make you.
Making a video where you disagree with part of your audience on a topic is not "cancel culture".
@CringeInfluence I'm edgy as fuck and I don't think Leafy was funny.
@CringeInfluence You don't have to know LeafyIsHere to like edgy content.
@CringeInfluence Your fans disagreeing with you is NOT being cancelled. Also Diesel isn't even political in his videos. And as well you can be edgy and non-political.
@CringeInfluence LOL younger audiences are some of the most edgy. You're not making content for them with permission from their parents, kids love edgy humour.
@CringeInfluence If someone loses respect for you because of some opinion you have, then you deserve a better audience. Don't bow down to stans.
@CringeInfluence Also many people who are ACTUALLY edgy have a career in the same style of content as you such as Diesel Patches or Gundam.
@CringeInfluence Saying "neopronouns are cringe" is not edginess. It's an opinion. Edginess is pushing boundaries to break norms for humorous or satirical purposes. You are simply expressing an opinion that some people disagree with.
@CringeInfluence You are allowed to. In fact it's quite a popular opinion, there's just a small annoying minority who disagrees. This isn't cancel culture, it's just people disagreeing.
@CringeInfluence You can disagree with your audience respectfully, and if they leave, you're probably better off without that audience.
@CringeInfluence This is why most gameplay/reaction commentators are so stale nowadays. Every one has the same easy opinion "poki bad" "vegan teacher bad" and they are too afraid to actually have opinions on anything slightly controversial.
@CringeInfluence Also saying "neopronouns are cringe" isn't 'being funny', it's just an opinion.
@CringeInfluence who cares
Also if you're not funny and you're a reaction/gameplay commentator, then your videos are most likely shit.
@LtCythix_ @GayAreZee @CringeInfluence @Pantherz45 @JadynIsBanned @PrisonMateLuke @TheBrettBurnz You're not deflecting criticism, but imo it's not a good style lol
"The reason i'm not funny is cancel culture" 
@GayAreZee @LtCythix_ @CringeInfluence @Pantherz45 @JadynIsBanned @PrisonMateLuke @TheBrettBurnz I don't see how those two points have anything to do with each other.
@LtCythix_ @CringeInfluence @Pantherz45 @JadynIsBanned @PrisonMateLuke @TheBrettBurnz Not all of them. In fact the videos of yours I like the most are the ones with a proper structure and flow.
@LtCythix_ @CringeInfluence @Pantherz45 @JadynIsBanned @PrisonMateLuke @TheBrettBurnz I know how you structure your videos. Also if you are indeed criticizing all these commentators for completely different things, it makes it worse in some ways, as it sounds like it would be a bit clunky, like smushing 3 critique videos into one.
@LtCythix_ @CringeInfluence @Pantherz45 @JadynIsBanned @PrisonMateLuke @TheBrettBurnz *bad research, not bad editing
@LtCythix_ @CringeInfluence @Pantherz45 @JadynIsBanned @PrisonMateLuke @TheBrettBurnz What most people criticise about Luke though is not "him being on a high horse", but false accusations and bad editing. If you have a video where you mention both as "bad commentators", people will inevitably assume things.
@CringeInfluence @LtCythix_ @Pantherz45 @JadynIsBanned @PrisonMateLuke @TheBrettBurnz I do agree. It's a bad idea to make a video on "bad commentators" as a blanket term. One on bad content and another on bad people/research would be better.

Yeah, no wonder he "apologized" to me right after Willy said he was gonna make a video. When questioned, John said to me he didn't even know Willy was making a video because he doesn't follow much drama, what a weaselly little liar. 
@2__roman That's my point, there aren't really any sites, I have to do the research myself.

@CommentaryLs @AugieRFC @BanishedJourno @_ThePieman_ Fattest L in the history of commentary right here.
After it was revealed John lied about the Dream stuff, I don't think I can trust the sincerity of his "apology" to me. There were a lot of really suspicious stuff with how he "apologized" to me, but I wanted to get this drama out the way so I let this go. I will reveal more soon.
@Real_aMac At this point, unless it was an elaborate bait by half the community, I'm sure there's evidence and it will come in due time.
The whole drama was stupid and boring in the first place. Commentators only made videos about it so they could have Dream in the title.
All I'll say on the Dream stuff is that I never took sides and I'm glad I never did.
@Real_aMac @HarleyTBSYT I agree, it doesn't seem like him. That's why if this is true then my entire view of him is changed and I may no longer be inclined to believe him on other matters.
@KrzearYT On the Reddit for Iceberg Charts I've seen quite a few good Minecraft ones you could take some inspiration from. Honestly I've been hooked on these iceberg videos lol, they're so interesting, even on subjects I wouldn't usually be interested in.
I'm in the process of making a commentary iceberg chart for a video. While I do have quite a bit of knowledge on the history of drama in the community, I would very much appreciate it if I got some help, so DM me on Twitter or Discord if you have ideas or want to help.
RT @MorePieman : "Keemstar is always right" 
@KEEMSTAR @Dream @JohnSwanYT I find it so funny how shocked Keem is at the even mention of 'the n-word', given his past.
"Keemstar is always right" 
Looking at the pyro vs keemstar face reveal drama from 2016. This is really complex shit with pretty valid arguments from both sides.
@Krazzf @KEEMSTAR @Bowblax and where's the french girl interview?
@Stafoh @CommentaryLs 
@citsira @bunkboySF We all support you.
Not taking sides as I really don't care about this drama, but this is interesting.

@Spooky_Banks The Ivory stuff has nothing to do with the french girl stuff.
@Sub2Michae1 
@Spooky_Banks Leafy and Grade's only good points were shit everyone already knew because it had been regurgitated 100 times by EVERYONE in the commentary community.
@Spooky_Banks I'm not saying the video's not boring, I'm saying based on just whether the videos are factual or not iDubbbz and Pyro's were the only ones who had some good criticisms.
@Spooky_Banks Pyro made many valid points in his. I admit he went too far with some of it and Keem definitely never doxxed him byut the French girl situation for example was all on Keem.
good or bad? 
@_Davidplex True, it wasn't really doxxing, but it was still shitty on Keem for exposing it to more people.
"
Still the best content cop"
@cyclonelmao NO
@KarmapockyD Yeah, I can still criticize him. He's better now though, but people act like 2016 never existed lol
"People forget so fast...
"
I know Leafy has been "rehabilitated" in the commentary community but he was still a cringy as fuck edgelord who made repetitive videos and had no self-awareness.
@cyclonelmao I'm covering this in a video I'm working on but Leafy and Grade were just as bad as Keemstar in that situation.
@cyclonelmao True, but some shit they said about Keemstar was legit insane. Grade accused Keemstar of asking 15 year olds for nudes and of abusing his wife. Leafy also made really bad accusations with no proof.
Apart from the Content Cop and Pyro's video, every Keemstar exposed video from 2016 was filled with 90% rubbish.
I've already written 2 scripts and I'm halfway through another.
I'm not sure how strict they are in America with this stuff but I know in Australia they are super harsh on sexting shit. 
@PunishedProject They do have every right to do it, but at the same time its a stupid idea to do so.
RT @OrdinaryGamers : James Charles is a dipshit for sexting fans. Dude should know how risky this stuff is especially with really young fans, no real excuses.
Yeah this is why people get into this shit.

@NotAPluglol @OhMarPriv So all I did wrong was make a joke in private, which I apologized for already and she accepted. After that I made some non-sexual simpy tweets and then I joked about her blocking me so she did, I don't see the issue lmao.
@jadeechonn 5
@NotAPluglol @OhMarPriv She replied something jokingly (she wasn't upset) then I replied with a joke about her blocking me, then she blocked me, so the block was probably a joke (which is why I responded with a joke).
@NotAPluglol @OhMarPriv she posted one of those personality memes with each color saying what you think about her and I said the color which said something like "i wanna kiss" or something. Not sexual, just jokingly simping.
@NotAPluglol @OhMarPriv I didn't joke sexually about her after she told me not to lol. I made a sexual joke about her in a private Cards Against Humanity game and then I apologized to her in private which she accepted.

@Sub2Michae1 @Arlus From when I was 9 to 13 I was a redditor. I am now a changed man.
POV: You're @Arlus looking for a meme to post on Twitter 
@RedeemedMisfit @Sub2Michae1 But Augie's right. He didn't make jokes about me being a pedo.
@Sub2Michae1 Turns out he was 100% sincere the whole time. Just like I thought.
@KrzearYT I'm not sure. The big trend then was making people's subscribers go down (therefore decreasing watch time and ad revenue for youtube). Since YouTube changed the live sub counts it hasn't been much of a thing.
@jadeechonn 9 and 5
TikTok probably doesn't want drama. Same reason why YouTube banned live sub counts in 2019.

@Lararippp @aliceisbacc @_ThePieman_ So people will ignore what John did because of one comparison they disagree with? Pretty stupid
"@aliceisbacc @_ThePieman_ I disagree, I only compared ImAllexx and John's responses. I never said what John did is comparable to what ImAllexx did as well.
Also that is besides the point of the video. Try to focus on the actual points I make and not dwell on minutiae."
@aliceisbacc @BanishedJourno @_ThePieman_ Because both of your tweets can easily be answered by the same response.
@aliceisbacc @BanishedJourno @_ThePieman_ I compared their responses to their subjective dramas, not what they did originally. So I'm not saying what John did is remotely comparable to ImAllexx's wrongs, but their responses were similar in style and substance.

@_ThePieman_ (obviously being sarcastic if you couldn't tell)
@Pridwynn @_ThePieman_ John fucked up more and he still hasn't apologized or taken responsibility. I have. That's the difference and he needs to be held accountable.
@Pridwynn @_ThePieman_ If Dream did this people would be making videos left and right.
@Pridwynn @_ThePieman_ I came close to killing myself. John made fun of it and said I faked feeling suicidal. People need to know.
@Pridwynn @_ThePieman_ But did I deserve to get harassed endlessly? Was John right for accusing me of suicide baiting with no evidence?
@Pridwynn @_ThePieman_ I'm 15. It was weird but not terrible. I also blocked her right after learning of her age (she lied about her age, saying she was 13).
@loafyyyyyyy @Pridwynn @_ThePieman_ Yes, it was weird. However i'm 15 and I didn't deserve to get harassed like I did. It's weird but not deplatform worthy. I never defended what I did, I said what happened after to mewas disgusting.
@Pridwynn @_ThePieman_ No, it was a 3 year age gap. Many people inc. Nick, Augie and WillyMac have defended me over this. After hundreds of people called me a pedophile and gave me death threats I came close to killing myself. John Swan then said I faked it with 0 evidence.
@Pridwynn @_ThePieman_ i do go outside + go back to sucking John's dick
@sutcoT @_ThePieman_ There's way more to the story than that. Watch the video when it releases.

@LtCythix_ PewDiePie's channel is so large that if he uploads daily he is bound to get that much views. His channel has definitely declined during the last year (in views and imo quality), but even in late 2019 when he was getting 10M views per daily upload it was 10% of his sub count.
@LtCythix_ always surprises me the amount of little kids who watch commentary, even though I was 10 when I got into it

Blocking people for giving you fair criticism is definitely shitty, but if people are just spamming your shit with the same thing constantly then I think you have every right to block the perpetrators.
My policy on blocking people has changed significantly over the past 2 years or so. In the beginning, I thought blocking people was kinda a pussy move. But as I got bigger I realised the only way to keep your sanity on this website is to block the morons out.

Now to determine precisely how mankind impacts global climate change today is rather difficult, assuming it’s even possible.
It can be some minor Earth axis inclination or the orbit of its around the sun shifted, which can lead, historically speaking, to significant climate changes on earth. Those were colossal changes that led to dramatic consequences. Whether they were good or bad, they were dramatic
Nobody knows the legitimate reasons for global climate change. After all, we know such periods in Earth’s history when there were drops and rises in the temperature. It can be caused by some global processes in the universe.

@trollstah EU hasn’t reached your Latvia yet, because you fellows are still useful idiots in their campaign against Russia. Latvia is still pretty unstable and can fall into Russia’s hands pretty quickly, which is another reason they would affect your culture, yet.
@trollstah It all hinges on on your social views. I’m a traditionalist and being under Russian rule would be more beneficial for me. Maybe you are a pretty liberal guy than EU is a better choice than Russia. EU will barely keep you, while Russia will make you a part of Russia.
@trollstah You wish your country to be enslaved by Germany and France if so enjoy. Stay occupied by the titans. We know Latvia is an expert at that.

RT @NickJFuentes : GOP has been in control of House, Senate, White House, &amp; Supreme Court for many years and yet the country continues to go in the same direction every year no matter which party is in control. Clearly voting for the nominally "lesser of two evils" isn't working.
RT @NickJFuentes : Conservative voters have to be willing to let Republicans lose elections if they are not sufficiently Right Wing. "Better than the Democrat opponent" is no longer a good enough standard, we must demand better and be willing to let the GOP fail if it falls short.

@TumoralGrowth @DarrenJBeattie Tito kept everything intact through bold foreign policy and outstanding domestic policy.
@TumoralGrowth @DarrenJBeattie Yugoslavia comprises primary 3 tribes (Carantania, Serbs, Croats). Tito did a phenomenal job with Yugo and his economic prosperity took place because of a sharp mind named Branko Horvat, who was the mastermind behind the economic ideology.
@TumoralGrowth @DarrenJBeattie Tito is amazing, correct.

@punisheddogg @RedFoxComms What about Team George Floyd Gaming?
"@BasedSerbian @ciguliguu @gggglysh I get that.

I'm just talking about Serbia being optimized their potential in Yugoslavia, economically."
@RedFoxComms I'm Team George Floyd Gaming
@ciguliguu @BasedSerbian @gggglysh Serbia benefitted massively in Yugoslavia.
"@BasedSerbian @gggglysh I know. It all depends on the figure that wants to unite them. The right person can get these countries to unite sooner than you think because all of the Ex-Yugo countries are doing horribly since the fall of Yugoslavia.

Also this:
"
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh It will be the Slavic anthem when Putin gets all the Slavic country back to Russia.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh Fun fact: 
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh There is a reason why it was the Yugoslavian Anthem.
"@BasedSerbian @gggglysh TITO WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG.

FUCK GLOBALISM!!!"
@gggglysh @BasedSerbian America First.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh I still think is the smartest economic move of the last century. A country needs to make itself not dependent on foreign countries. This will make these prices and wages go hand in hand instead of being controlled by foreign countries.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh The prices were extremely low, due to all of the products were made in Yugoslavia.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh Yugoslavia benefitted massively from being neutral. Both the West and Soviet gave trading options, while the Yugoslav people were quite low-paid, but the prices were extremely low. (A economic mastermove from Horvat)
@gggglysh @BasedSerbian We are talking about history, dear.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh Bulgaria was an extremely important country position-wise for the USSR. Also, the USSR didn't have the control they wanted in Yugoslavia, which is why they didn't allow Yugoslavia to take over Bulgaria.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh Tito wanted Bulgaria, but the Soviets didn't allow it. Bulgaria would have been a huge W for Yugoslavia. The idea of Yugoslavia for Tito was to unite all South Slavs.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh Misic did a lot work for soo many countries throughout WW1
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh The concept of Yugoslavia would never work as great Serbia. It needed to have a separate identity. Yugoslavia(South Slavs) was a genius way to create a country.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh I'm impressed that he came out as the biggest winner of WW1
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh Depends. Tito didn't show support to any of his colleagues which made it extremely hard to establish the next leader of SKJ. Yugoslavia needed a leader to unite the people for a longer period because Nationalism wasn't eliminated.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh Karadjordje dynasty was pretty bad tbf. Tito was extremely liked when he came to power. He was a marshal and a war hero for the people. Tito was like Putin for Russia today. He represented the country.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh Tito's main mistake was making federals/states and not having a successor. He should denounce all of the federals to stop nationalism.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh Economically not a communist. I legit adore the economic genius Branko Horvat. Tito was pretty hard against speech tho. hahah
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh Is extremely sad seeing Balkan these days. All of them act like nationalists but at the same time are packing their stuff, so they can move to Germany. Yugoslavia was a force in Europe, unlike these shitty governed countries.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh The main difference between the people from Yugoslavia is religion. I don't get how religion is playing this big of a role. You guys basically speak the same language and hate the same people, lol.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh If NATO was fair then they would have bombed both countries. The Yugoslavian Civil War was retarded on all parameters. Firstly, because Yugoslavia is made mainly of 3 tribes Carantanian, Serbs, and Croats (Slavic tribes).
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh The only time NATO did something, lol. Serbia didn't deserve it, but man some of the people in JNA did retarded stuff in Bosnia (Croatia also had a lot of blood on their hands to be fair).
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh The guy literally caused the Balkan wars while losing full control of Kosovo. The US even bombed the shit out of Serbia.
@BasedSerbian @gggglysh I don't think she knows how fucking bad Milosevic was, lol.
@BasedSerbian You made a knockout punch with Milosevic.

There is a big group of non-believers that try to lecture us on our religion without reading the Bible. This perception of Jesus being a hippie that loves everyone is false, and it shows you haven't read the Bible.

@LittleFroakie65 Same here. I have never seen so much cringe in one place. I now understand why Fuentes shit on cringy superchats.

@nicholasdeorio Me: 
@junegloom4 @Lross67365570 @GreatMcNate @SHEsus__Christ You are not challenging anything. Unfortunately June, you are just throwing empty statements to something that can't be proven. Have a good day.
@TrollFaceMan9 @nicholasdeorio Agree, TrollFace.
RT @ScottMGreer : San Francisco public school teacher claims all of her problems are caused by 13% of her students  
@TrollFaceMan9 @nicholasdeorio No idea. I have heard bad things about Twitter but thought it was similar to Quora.
@nicholasdeorio Being verified is a privilege. No idea, how @NickJFuentes became verified but glad he did.
@nicholasdeorio Twitter is a shithole. I'm finding that out very fast. So many grandstanders on here is crazy.
@nicholasdeorio Lindsay should honestly shut up. Every relationship ever has a power dynamic and is not fair to call these relationships as predatory by nature. Lindsay should get back in the kitchen instead of saying nonsensical statements on Twitter.
@junegloom4 @Lross67365570 @GreatMcNate @SHEsus__Christ You are not helping yourself by being ignorant. As I said we don't know if God does exist or not. There is a very good chance that the universe needed a creator (God) to be created.
They are enjoying life, since Biden became America's president. 
@junegloom4 @Lross67365570 @GreatMcNate @SHEsus__Christ Where is your evidence that God doesn't exist. Just because you don't think God doesn't exist, doesn't mean you are correct. We don't know if God exist or not.
@Lross67365570 @GreatMcNate @SHEsus__Christ Yes is a bank, but that's not relevant. They are referring to real reports that come to this conclusion.
@AugieRFC That is a fat Zip Code, sounds like Tipster's zip code.
@martpunished @ScottMGreer We need a strong leader with a spine, ASAP. China and Russia are literally bullying us.

"@RedWorldLeader Putin is amazing. 

Also, had to delete the tweet because of a spelling mistake haha."
Putin is restoring the Church, keeping gender ideology out of classrooms, 12-week abortion ban, 13% flat tax, bringing the oligarchs to heel, protecting Russia's national integrity and strategic interests in Crimea; what's not to like about Putin? He is literally Russia First!
@maggiebattlesxo @TheRalphRetort Putin is not taking Biden serious is hilarious.
@BobbyVoe @natsechobbyist @BradMossEsq He is probably dead by then. Biden can't even finish an interview anymore.
@PBudd5 @natsechobbyist @BradMossEsq I'm just stating the truth. Lobbyism is a massive issue in this country and none of the parties will try to stop it. Politics is not run through our politicians but through Unions and companies.
@PBudd5 @natsechobbyist @BradMossEsq All politicians are corrupt. Both teams were bad.
@natsechobbyist @BradMossEsq What a cringe comment. Just look at Biden 5 years ago compared to now. 
@Andywarski @TheRalphRetort Lmao
@HoteppuMoses @disclosetv Love our greatest ally.
@disclosetv On a serious note, this clip just shows that Putin doesn't respect Biden. Putin jokes about Biden not being healthy (dementia) and he wishes Biden good health. Is clear that Putin doesn't see Biden as a threat.
@natsechobbyist @BradMossEsq He is joking about Biden's health. Is clear as day that Biden has dementia.

@HamAlpha1 @NickJFuentes Destiny super cringe
@DarrenJBeattie Putin is a pretty awesome leader, indeed. Strong personality, which makes him respected all over the world.

On another note, what are your thoughts on the Kingdom of Bosnia's coat of arms? It looks pretty epic to me. "
@BasedSerbian @Taps77w @AugieRFC That's great to hear. Why was Stefan Nemanja not Nemanjic? I have been thinking about that for some time. The same happened with the Bosnian Kingdom where Ban Kulin wasn't named Kulinic, which was the dynasty's name.
RT @CatholicGroyper : God &gt; “Science!!!!!” 
@BasedSerbian @Taps77w @AugieRFC That's great to hear. I think we all should know our own history.
@BasedSerbian @Taps77w @AugieRFC Just google Slavoj Zizek. He is pretty well known.
@BasedSerbian @Taps77w @AugieRFC Tito economically wasn't a Marxist. He was embracing his own set of economists that were extremely talented. Just read about Branko Horvat, who was the main reason for the economic uprise in Yugo. Horvat was the best economist of the 20th century. His work with Yugo was amazing.
@BasedSerbian @Taps77w @AugieRFC The Civil war was one factor to the economic decline of the Balkans. Even without the Civil war was Yugoslavia having a massive issue due to inflation, which was created due to the party not allowing the economists to work their magic, because everyone was preparing for war.
@BasedSerbian @Taps77w @AugieRFC He was a pretty epic man. Unfortunately, Balkan has fallen massive since his death.
@BasedSerbian @Taps77w @AugieRFC Fortunately he was

@mister_baecon @BasedSerbian I can't say a bad word about Josip Broz Tito.

@AustinKilgore3 @Bowblax I'm getting thinner because of him.
@JigSaw69K @AugieRFC You have misunderstood what a religion is than.
@nankita @UzmaManzoor23 @DarrenJBeattie You can easily create your own opinion based on books. You don't have to watch talk shows for that. The thing you can use talk shows for is challenging your opinion and nothing more.

"RT @KEEMSTAR : Not 1 single Tea Channel covered my story about Trisha Paytas Sexually harassing me for years! 

They say they care &amp; believe all accusers. My situation is not even up for debate. Everyone seen the tweets. 

These tea channels &amp; reporters don’t care about REAL proven victims! "

&gt;had to watch it at like 1.5 times speed

&gt;I think he's not sorry "

"RT @TheWandererIsOP : You looked up to me so I may look down on you.

You really are enjoying this attention, aren’t you?

if you ever looked up to me, or do, please seek help. instead of empty apologies, just leave Liz + the others that don’t want to associate w/ you anymore.

That includes me. "
RT @FridaysOVPyro : I'm disappointed, I entered this community expecting better. You feel no sorrow for anything. I can go on, but no. What you need is help but you won't. Why? A million reasons none I'll say. Maybe one day you'll be civilised but the past will haunt you and everyday you'll wish to 
And btw you left out a lot of shit. Another reason as to why I don't accept the apology.
Small response to this. You should've apologized a long time ago genuinely but I will not accept this apology. Get off the internet and get some help, you need to improve yourself bc of how fucked in the head you are. 
"RT @tilbatkamahe : Maybe last thing I'm gonna say.

Someone's dead dad and call it edgy. Again go fuck yourself you are a terrible person and a total degenerate. And btw last statement he said I never made fun of his dad, other people did. Again kaz go fuck yourself.
Oh yeah and not only that he got his two degen friends to also make fun of my dad's death too. He's fucked in the head. Another thing he made an entire fucking accusation towards me lying in a GC and thought it was hilarious. You don't joke about
I don't mean to put this publically but what you did is very unforgivable you don't fucking joke about my dead dad, apologise, then take back the apology after I denied it. Go fuck yourself.

There it is 
@rickyberwick @JohnSwanYT @BanishedJourno Not with you Ricky. It starts at 8 ball and suddenly I’m drunk with a kid
@JohnSwanYT @BanishedJourno The cost argument people make is like getting mad someone bought a supreme shirt instead of going to good will.
@JohnSwanYT @BanishedJourno The fact of the matter is it comes down to preference. People like to pretend we live in 2010 and the iPhone doesn’t have features like background wallpaper yet.
@wwarrior_1 I kind of want to dunk on him by playing the stream where he calls me and Keemstar pe*os
@Cpt_Eggbeard @BanishedJourno I’m sorry are you poor?
@arsmalnweak12 Tbf it’s from December and literally dying on my desktop
@BanishedJourno Case in point 
@BanishedJourno This is like asking Twitter if you should build your own pc. Their opinions are terrible, the iPhone is a super good handset.
I don’t want to throw out my entire Onision video but like he’s nearly faded entirely into irrelevancy so I almost think it would be counter productive?
@JesskaPizzle That’s what every single hot tub stream is and if you’re denying that you’re quite literally in denial
"Worse support**** typo

Anyways one last thing, I feel like this “look guy she’s breaking the TOS” feels similar to when people run to drama channels and say we “harass people”. Idk, if no one is getting hurt I don’t think I’d bother crying about it."
The same reason everyone is mad about Twitch’s female bias is the same reason why people are confused why Twitch made the worst possible response in this situation. The wide issue is a fucked up TOS, worse enforcement than YouTube, worse poor support than YouTube &amp; visible bias.
@PogSwan Nick was right again
@TheQuartering I would disavow this but this is literally what he does to people.
@tommycsftp I’ve been listening to you watch this clip back and giggle for the last 5 minutes
@Flamencotrr I mean “thot content” seems to preform well
@Flamencotrr Who said that? Can you interact with what I said?
@Flamencotrr I’m arguing a videos’s metadata is designed to bring in lowest denominator incels because they are a popular demographic to pull in.
@Flamencotrr No it says Twitch is to strip clubs is what Netflix is to blockbuster. I get you like his videos but Jesus Christ my dude lmao
@kawakitard @Flamencotrr Shameless is boring af
@Femrocynical I’m asking what kind of people consume incel bait content. Content produced to bait incels. Gundam and even the actual video are irrelevant because we are focusing on the metadata and the people it appeals to
@Flamencotrr No but the title and thumbnail absolutely fucking is which is why I made a tweet about it?
"The entire goal of metadata is to target a specific audience. My tweet is just questioning why there are people who consume incel content like this?

It’s not even like every video he makes is incel bait so I don’t know why people are making it all about Gundam either."
"I’m confused lmao

What do you think a title thumbnail are designed to do? "

@red_day_tripper I’ve watched some of his other content and enjoyed it. Tommy was or is a big fan too.
Just to be clear, it doesn’t have to be Gundam specifically. I’m just wondering who consumes this incel bait content. I don’t think that encompasses all of Gundams content.
@PatchesPetrol I doesn’t have to be Gundam specifically. It’s just this incel bait content
I feel like I need to ask 2018 Turkey Tom to explain this phenomena to me

@Technicals_ ASAP we got a narrative to correct
I've stopped tweeting out milestones since someone told me those get annoying, so I'll tack on thanks for 60k because that's coming in hot too! Love ya'll
100k views a video used to be "my threshold for success" and people told me that was "too ambitious for a channel my size". That I'm "preparing myself for disappointment" if I deem success at double my sub count. Well since September I haven't missed!
The new video has jumped from 5/10 to 1/10 for me. I appreciate the fuck out of the support for my first sponsored video. I like to be cocky a lot but I'll never get over how much I appreciate you guys giving me these kinds of consistent numbers.

Where it started and how it's going 
Yeah? 
He didn't even keep me banned 24 hours lol
wait lol
@BillBaines_ I don’t remember. Might have
I have slept like 3 hours in 4 days and I just came up with the theory that iDubbbz wrote the Content Cop 2 on Keemstar and never released it. Then he gave it to Ethan Klein.
The problem with this project is that it’s literally 2 full length videos and I have no fucking clue why I did this to myself
@AugieRFC Rendering in parts and it’s a long wait. This video is like an hour and a half
@AugieRFC Late probably
Loved this video by Tom 
Yes the video is still coming today. Rendering now
@benjeuk Oh didn’t mean you specifically. It’s existed with time stamps to skip to. Very similar to my Twitch streamers video
@JayExci If you post more than one video they will call you a money whore. Having lots of thoughts is not allowed
@benjeuk I’m not to worried about length. It’s like 7 mini loosely connected videos so if you’re bored you can just skip to the next one.
For those asking why it’s 3 days long, the project was supposed to be 20-25 minutes. I’m well over an hour
@CommentCopped Prepare to clip me from this video for a long time lmaooo

Oh no he's going to draw John Swan 
For those wondering, these are mostly in ascending order and the overarching talking point is hypocrisy. So it’s a gradual build. For the most point, we don’t retread into previous videos.

Shut up 
@OvidiuRo7 @Bowblax Ask those people??
@OvidiuRo7 @Bowblax No I don't remember a YouTube comment live
Even the people who completely disavow all forms of edgy humor who may have been edgy themselves admit that they have made this type of racial humor in the past but when they describe it, they call their words “misguided and cringe”. For Keem it’s racist.
@PotassiumHoard1 My nuclear take for that situation is that I realistically haven’t spent more than 30 seconds caring about it.
Maybe a nuclear take however, I think the first post proves his point effectively and he doesn't need to go full Insider Jouno and pretend Keem's 2017 "Fiver Guys" WSJ joke was hateful in nature.
"Def Noodles paired a gotcha post with edgy jokes to try further paint Keemstar as an anti-Semite. 

I understand the tolerance/willingness to defend edgy humor has dissipated due to optics but at the very least removing Keem saying he was joking 3x is why people hate this guy. "

How am I not verified yet after 30+ impersonation accounts spamming my account with my/my firends dox this year and constant illegal DMCA abuse without a direct line to Twitter?
Refiled all 3 counter notifications Twitter refuses to answer and sent the person threatening to swat me... my address as required. Thank you Twitter!
It's actually insane that Twitter doesn't require you to showcase any proof you own the rights to something before filing a strike.
"RT @AugieRFC : I need me and my friends to get a little bigger on YouTube so we can have total control of the narrative when it comes to these YouTube stories

Fuck it. Adding H3 to the video. Still tomorrow release. Second all nighter this week!
@MorePieman I agree that this is an issue most of the time. However, I myself didn’t get dislike bombed on my video I made on Keemtar when I had 1000 subscribers but I did get hammered on my Quartering video which had a 50% at release. I feel it varies.
@BanishedJourno It felt like the spiritual successor to Drake and Josh which was also a show I really enjoyed. I remember watching the premiere in 2007 lmao
Real talk it’s PG-13 rated and I’m psyched as fuck to watch this

@AugieRFC Bro it’s painful.
@delightfulsauce Doesn’t matter. He probably didn’t know they were dating.

Ethan saying shit like this takes away from the criticism that James Charles deserves. What happened to the guy who always had great nuanced takes? Dudes been in permanent decline since 2016.

"@Bowblax @AugieRFC @CordWit Lol I think people are misinterpreting my tweet. I was just joking guys. Sorry if this was being read weird. 

I was expecting lol to be in the replies. This is not serious"
"@Bowblax @AugieRFC You’re guys innocence is dying right infront of my eyes. 

I just hope @CordWit can be a beacon of hope"
@NewsM101 @JohnSwanYT There’s literally more evidence of John being a sociopath than dream. All that guy did was cheat in Minecraft.
"@NewsM101 @JohnSwanYT No I didn’t miss that. What I said still stands

People should apologize if they promote (even accidentally) a false narrative against someone. 

John had so many people promote false narratives against Dream. Meaning that they should apologize to dream."
@NewsM101 @JohnSwanYT So you shouldn’t apologize when fooled into promoting blatant lies?

@BanishedJourno not discrediting, just checking the casualty number
@BanishedJourno did he lie about and throw as many friends under the bus as john?
"@ShanMark18 ""professionalism"" was a word in johns dms used to defend him. 

They said since John used ""professionalism"" in recent dms, the kid would have said that and used the same word. 

I was called retarded for saying that was nothing lmaoooo"

bruh i don't wanna hear your sob story."

This is my new hype man

Your apology can ligma  
@ShanMark18 John just admitted it.
@JohnSwanYT glad you're taking your own advice 
"@JohnSwanYT You're a fucking liar. 

You let my friends attack me.

And you refused to own up till you ABSOLUTLEY HAD TO.

I wouldn't be surprised if this was your manager asshole."
@CordWit I just think it's funny he let everyone rally against me and was happy about. Pattern of behavior. dudes character is shit.
@nicholasdeorio Dude sat by happy as a clam, while you and me went at it. Fuck this dude

"@nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision Also let’s not forget the key difference between bowblax and John!!!

"
"@nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision When did I say you were? 

All I said is that if it wasn’t John, this would be a bigger story. That’s my opinion.

Please don’t give me any long hypotheticals. You can call me if you want. This isn’t that serious haha"
@nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision Plus bowblax apologized and fixed it. John has only double downed. If John did the same as bowblax, I wouldn’t be talking about it
"@nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision Yes. I think going into his gaming stream and making him cry was a bit ass-holish.

And yes I think you’re biased towards john.

But he’s your friends. It’s okay to be that way man lol. Just saying that I feel like I can really notice"
@nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision Yes I think you guys are bias. Who cares. Why does that bother you. Your his friend
No u! 
@nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision Why are you so mad lol.
@nicholasdeorio @Bipplerr @CordWit @BigMoneyOnision Lol you don’t have to reply to everyone bro. It’s good. We can talk if I bothered you haha
@nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision I can’t help you man.
"@nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision I’m not being aggressive just saying it how it is. I don’t know how you want me to respond to these long confusing tweets

Just call me if you are confused."
@Bowblax @nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision Yeah I don’t expect you to make a vid on it obviously. It’s not your content.
@nicholasdeorio @AugieRFC @Bowblax @BigMoneyOnision Yo but anyone who thinks this guy is lying about the dream dms is way off. It’s not in his character at all.
"@Bowblax @nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision So  claiming a 15 year old fan is suicide baiting, and walking up to the door of calling a 15 year old a pedo isn’t enough to make a video?

Lol alright. Different standards I guess."
@Bowblax @nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision Yeah, but that’s not what John did. John pretty much called him a pedo, and then said he suicide baited for attention and sympathy
@nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision Lol he won’t fuck you bro
"@nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision Huh?

Nah were saying this would be a massive story if it wasn’t John."
@BigMoneyOnision Exactly
@nicholasdeorio I am going to dream you.
That ain’t the real Turkey Tom btw
@Bowblax It’s coming
I will bully every commentator
@nicholasdeorio I mean I believe you. Not how I read it tho.
"@nicholasdeorio If this was intended for John and not me, I think this was poorly written.

I was the only person talking about this today. Don’t didn’t see John tweet about it.

I mean dog you quote me. "
@nicholasdeorio Another one 
@nicholasdeorio I read this wrong then. My interpretation. 
"@nicholasdeorio Don’t talk about Zaptie nick. It’s old news.

Lol if it was anyone else we wouldn’t hear this. 
@nicholasdeorio Keep sucking that dick lol
"RT @CReborn26 : @WillyMacShow No one will say anything lol 

This stuck out to me though. But hey John did nothing wrong 😂😂😂 I'm calling his mo- I mean his manager "
Maybe it’s cause they all wrote off pieman’s entire video for little reason :/ 
The silence is deafening from the commentary community lol 
@munkealt wouldn't know seeing that john deleted all of them, but isn't apologetic at all.

No it's not lol. They're kids going through puberty. its normal.

Then telling him to leave the internet "
"John Swan telling a kid who's 15 that being attracted to a 12 year old will haunt him for the rest of his life.

Nice guy. Totally would never lie about a DM. "
@Twizz_Fizz Literally
lol bro, this isn't a murder case. it's low tier circumstantial drama. Why so dramatic haha 
"What is more lame? the fact that dream got a Harvard grad to back up his minecraft speedrun.

@monkeymonkeyape Obviously there wouldn’t have been a stream if John didn’t blow it up

@BillBaines_ @nicholasdeorio He's over taking him.
@FloogieWoogie completly
this guy always says my takes are great
lol i am friends with the fake @nicholasdeorio and he's better than the real one 
"I'm fairly certain all John needed to do was talk to the ""family friend that hacked him,"" and get the log in to the fake dream account. 

That would clear his name.

Guess we gotta wait for an hour long video now. Honestly legendary drama lol."
"If there's more of these completely reasonable explanations I think John was probably telling the truth.

There are still some questions that need answers. And dream isnt wrong for faulting John (cause how could he have known)

This will literally end as a big misunderstanding🤮"
"The next day John was ""hacked"" and the hacker saw the screenshots between Harley and Cobra (posted above). 

Since they saw those screenshots, they knew Harley and Cobra didn't get along. Clearing up how the hacked John Swan knew about their beef. "
"The more i digest it, the more the LT Cobra screenshot thing makes sense. It clears up the biggest question about John's defense.

This is the theory:

This is LT Cobra's screenshot argument with Harley. Cobra sent this to John venting while they were playing games. "
.@AugieRFC is the start of the pipeline to becoming a sonic furry. Will fight with him more often to stop his agenda
@Bowblax Dude 100% I would be so hyped
@HelperMoonlight He didn’t. Harley isn’t the same kid.
@igp It reminds when leafy called idubbbz a cuck. Just swooping back from the grave lol
@HelperMoonlight Oh I didn’t know that.
@HarleyTBSYT has that happened to you? lol i just think its funny how both sides used you in their argument
@InternetUnwind literally only a year old
@HarleyTBSYT @CordWit @CordPriv yeah i see him. then he has to do this with everyone. Ninja literally got in trouble for that same shit earlier this week.
"John Swan backed out of a debate with a smiley face minecraft nerd who doesn't even show his face.

If he came on i bet they would have made up lol."
@RealEvanDoThin1 still up for me
@inkyblinked he doesn't need to show his name or face. just the kids voice along with the "fake dreams" discord tag.
"lol W

He can literally prove the 12 year old was him by using the “fake dream” account and comparing the user# numbers. 
"If John doesn’t want to talk to keem fair. But why does he need to prepare for a dream stream when the truth is the truth.

All he has to say is, it wasn’t me. They can’t prove anything. What do you need to prepare for? 

This shit be goofy. Imma go touch grass "
@Hank_HlLL @AugieRFC The only rational thing to do
"@AugieRFC Well that’s why he’s lying then. That’s my guess at least.

It’s like dream with the Minecraft speed run lie. Not a big deal, but now the lie blew up way bigger than it should have."
"@AugieRFC its all circumstantial. its just if its enough for you or not. Yeah i think he's lying. but really the whole thing isn't a big deal lmao. 

wish he went on Drama Alert. that shit would have been hilarious. Now the guy has a manager and PR team lmao."
"@AugieRFC Better than not doing it. Right now I’m almost positive John and Cobra (maybe someone else) were trolling Harley.

Now he’s lied and it’s blown up bigger than it should lmao. If he was telling the truth, and the truth was solid, go on drama alert."
It was me guys. I’m the 12 year old that framed dream
@HelloKittyDuvet Harley isn’t the 12 year old lol
@HelloKittyDuvet This doesn’t mean anything. It’s not like Harley would know or not.
@JohnSwanYT lol this will be over in 5 minutes. i don't want to watch this whole dream stream lol
Can't John just get the 12 year old to vouch for him lol. This shit is so dumb. call him.

@inkyblinked I made a whole thread already, I’m not gonna explain again, head there if you wanna see my thoughts
@inkyblinked John played victim to a post with 20 likes. Acted like it was a public attack Lmao
@Dewmonic_Abyss Lol @JohnSwanTY might be talking about his hacked account in the first tweet and then the fake dream in the other two???
@inkyblinked I agree with Dream almost fully on this
This whole thread is super virgin and I advice that you read it lol 
"@Khaliostad Saying, “you aren’t good at law,” isn’t criticism. He needs to explain why. 

We can’t even see the context of this thread.

If you can’t follow that, I can’t help you man 😂"
@Khaliostad If you don’t show the false claim, how can I address it?
"@Khaliostad The guy said John wasn’t good at law.

John said, can you explain?

I don’t see a problem here. He wants the criticism explained to him"
"@Khaliostad I really don’t think there’s many examples of John being like that. 

I just think John playing this stuff up for the audience"
"@kjisnthere2 If Dream posted to a Reddit forum with only 5000 people in it and the post only had 21 likes before John blew it up on Twitter....

Then it’s not much of a public attack. John made this big, not dream lol"
Dream did the equivalent of venting on discord
"To be clear: If I’m John I cash in on this too lol

Free million hit video thanks Dream!!"
"I think John is playing victim here man. The fact that the Reddit was super small makes this credibility attack lame.

But dreams needs to realize that with 16 millions subscribers, whatever he says will be seen/leaked.

Willymac solves the drama again. Thank you fam"
"-Dream doesn’t believe John was hacked (which he doesn’t have to).

-Dream hears John is making a vid on him

-Dream complains on small Reddit forum

-John says his credibility is being attacked"
"Honestly keems kinda right dude. 

Order of events (I think): John makes Minecraft documentary and talks to dream

-John forgets to log off computer and family friend starts sending messages from his account "
@demisaysstuff I’ve never even thought about this. I guess just partner. Right?
@NJtrashboys @KEEMSTAR Oh I’m unaware of his twitch or wherever he streams
@KEEMSTAR But John never made a video on dream. Right?
@nicholasdeorio @AugieRFC dream thinking that someone else is lying is hilarious when you look at his speed running career.
@nicholasdeorio @AugieRFC Yeah if it’s already resolved dream is being big snake
@InternetUnwind @AugieRFC Yeah I see that for sure
@InternetUnwind @AugieRFC Just seems like a weird misunderstanding and now it’s just trying to prove that dreams a douchebag from posting on Reddit with 20 upvotes.
@JohnSwanYT Lol dude was right so can’t hate
@InternetUnwind @AugieRFC I see no problem with this
@InternetUnwind @AugieRFC Clip?
"@AugieRFC So all that happened was some kid leaked the “fake dream” dms to Dream, cause John didn’t log out of a computer?

Dream then made the reddit post for whatever reason.

John then had to defend himself. Is that the whole story?"

Obviously not. But you said what they do behind closed doors is their business. Private messages is behind closed doors ffs.

Is it stupid to do? Yes. But is it also totally normal and natural for a couple? Yes. "
@meghan43589005 No
@CaspianSolstice So if they’re dating and fucking, it’s cool? But the pictures are too far? Stfu lol
I’m surrounded by retards 
"Literally doesn’t matter unless there is charges. Cops are worried about actual predators, not this shit. 

Twitter police have no common sense "
@NateIsLame @MorsonYt I’m just saying it how it is. Start calling police if it’s so bad dude. If not, then what are you doing lol
I can’t wait for them to add Jesus Christ to fortnight. Muhammad too
@NateIsLame Idk you at a different high school then. If that’s your experience I see how you feel that way. I just think people like you are making a mountain out of a mole hill.
@NateIsLame @MorsonYt Two high schoolers. Two high schoolers... Twitter police is f tier.
"@NateIsLame @MorsonYt I mean it’s not that nuanced. If you want kids to not date in that age gap. You need to not let them be in the same school and classes. 

Otherwise it’ll happen lol. Simple really"
@NateIsLame @ItzDangani I’m very clear. You can’t read
"@NateIsLame But if two kids are in school. They have class, sports, clubs, electives all together. And they form a relationship cause they’re both students.

It’s normal. If you want to stop that, break up high school."
@NateIsLame @MorsonYt Lol so you think it’s dangerous and gross. But we shouldn’t do anything about it? Classic.
"@NateIsLame @ItzDangani So you’re the guy that screams strawman when I say it how it is.

Nice. Age is irrelevant here. 2 years is nothing.  Non story. 

If it’s cause he’s famous, go after basketball players and rock stars for using their game to get laid too. 

Your arguments weak."
@MorsonYt @NateIsLame Guess you’re gonna have to arrest people at every high school then lmao. Happens everywhere.
"@NateIsLame @ItzDangani Nudes from minors? Dude it’s a 2 year age gap. It’s not that nuanced.

And lol famous people can’t engage with the opposite sex cause their famous? 

Your takes are as shallow as this drama"
@NateIsLame Can’t give a substantial rebuttal to a less substantial take 😞✌️
@NateIsLame @ItzDangani I’m gonna leverage my power on you with these whack takes.
@InhaletoExhale Tons of people are. That’s why I said it.
@NateIsLame Lame way to reword it. All you nerds living with your parents don’t lie
RT @carterhambley : so apparently it’s still a dui even if youre the birthday boy
@leinadmp4 Same
@Troyroyroy1st @Kyuss7731 Honestly all high schoolers suck at relationships. They’re learning. Most don’t work out for more than a few months
@BillBaines_ @leinadmp4 Lolol
@leinadmp4 @BillBaines_ People would probably just tease a bit over here but really not a big deal.
@FlambingoVEVO @Troyroyroy1st Rockstars and boy bands do it all the time too. So oh well if you ask me lol
@BillBaines_ @leinadmp4 The UK call each other pedos in their free time lol
"@AureusFinding @NateIsLame It happens at every school tho. If kids have: class, lunch, sports, clubs, electives together.. it’s gonna happen.

Break up the high schools then lol start arresting"
@leinadmp4 @BillBaines_ Lol yeah that obviously happens too
@BillBaines_ @leinadmp4 Yes.
"@BillBaines_ @leinadmp4 Yes. If kids spend time together: same sports, electives, lunch, friends, parties. Then there’s a chance for a relationship to build.

You literally have to break up high school if you want to fix this."
@GarrettHigh555 @RaptorIsBased @CapitolStormer @someserbs50th Not really a fact. Just you saying shit. If the kids spend time together, are into the same shit. It’s completely normal that they’d date.
@Kyuss7731 @Troyroyroy1st Lol you gotta be trolling
@leinadmp4 @BFettOfficial @SubToOptimus @AugieRFC Don’t the middle schoolers just get bullied to hell then?
@leinadmp4 @BFettOfficial @SubToOptimus @AugieRFC Oh okay. Yeah that’s different. It’s 9-12 here.
@FlambingoVEVO People mad cause I’m right
@leinadmp4 @BFettOfficial @SubToOptimus @AugieRFC Lololol. I Don’t know how British school works lol
@CapitolStormer Happens in schools all around the word. Nothing is done, cause it’s not a big deal :/
@Kyuss7731 It happens at every high school, go arrest people then.
"There’s no nuance to the Carson shit. He had a boner. She thought him being successful and famous was hot. They exchanged nudes.

That’s it. 2 year age gap is normal.

I solved the drama you spazes"
@leinadmp4 Bro it happens at every high school and college. Go arrest people then ffs
"If your boss wants to have sex with you, and you know there’s a promotion opening up, that’s an abuse of power.

Not him being famous. Fucking go after every boyband then"
@leinadmp4 I guess if the guys fucking held back lol
@FlambingoVEVO Bro I’m about to power dynamic you for saying this dumb shit.
"New rule. If the age gap is small enough for them to be in the same high school, it’d not pedophilia. 

It’s cool. 
I’ll be the only normal person on this."
"If your boss wants to have sex with you, and you know there’s a promotion opening up, that’s an abuse of power.

Not him being famous. Fucking go after every boy and then"
"Lick my sweaty balls if that’s your take away. 19-17 isn’t predatory.

Just cause someone’s successful, doesn’t make it predatory "
"Doesn’t matter if the law is broken if he’s not charged for it. 

Next up: Twitter goes after pot smokers cause it’s technically illegal in his state!!"

"@TAwakeChristian @CountDankulaTV @KEEMSTAR You’re basically saying these sites will give up their billion dollar industry! That’s silly!

Would never happen"
@KEEMSTAR Creators are small businesses too!
"@KEEMSTAR I would guess if it gets removed, they’d replace it with something that doesn’t give these sites unlimited power.

It’ll protect people from these shifty guidelines, that are often enforced seemingly at random.

We need protection!"
"@KEEMSTAR Removing section 230 would only make sites liable for its users if they choose to monitor it.

If they choose not to monitor the website, they wouldn’t be held liable.

"@Dippy12821579 I think that’s up to the viewer if they think pyro went too far with that. 

I was just speaking generally here."
@Ghostie_yt_ So let me get this straight. Pyro would be creepy for only 3 more months until ivory turned 16?
"@Dippy12821579 I doubt looking at those conversations. Dude have to go to the cops and then win in court.

Then what? Would you go to every high school in the country doing that same thing? Silly"
@Dippy12821579 Yes but 16 is legal where both of them are from. So what is there to be upset with? (Aside from arbitrary 3 year difference isn’t enough).
@ArchivedKnow Good take
"the big deal was that he wrote off ivory and called him a clout chaser. Ivory is a good kid and didn’t deserve to have his problems dismissed like that.

That’s why Turkey Toms vid was so important! He got answers and he got the apology to ivory!!!"
"Everyone mad at pyro for the age thing is dumb as hell. There’s literally 3 year and 2 or 3 month age difference between ivory and pyro.

Like we gonna call a 19 year old a pedo if ivory was 15 for 2 more months? Bro if it’s 6 months who the fuck really cares!?

Happens everywher"
@Femrocynical @Bowblax Thank you based Karen
@Femrocynical @Bowblax Even if it was 6 months I wouldn’t care. Literally happens at every high school around the world
@Femrocynical @Bowblax Lmaoo literallly like 2 or 3 months

@nicholasdeorio Like this kids fans of us. We can't be the one to burn him publicly. obviously that's gonna fuck him up. A god damn 15 year old is being called a pedo bro.

"@Croaxis_ @Herb_t45 No need to fear monger and go to code red. It would be fine lol. I know people on the internet and journalist do this all the time for clicks.

"@Croaxis_ @Herb_t45 YouTube only started enforcing their TOS as of 2017.

Yes their was pro racist, pedo, etc. videos being made. 

But they had like 5 views because most people are normal people. You would likely see no difference in the site.

Advertisers were around back then too ya know lol"
"@lil_steamy @GabeNwah @TAwakeChristian What websites? Like t spring? I would assume they would operate normally. 

They get asked to make something, then they sell it giving the creator some of the share.

I wouldn’t expect that to fall under 230"
"@lil_steamy @GabeNwah @TAwakeChristian Most creators use t spring. They front all of the expenses. Merch is made to order. The creator doesn’t have to invest a penny.

Any other questions you need answered lol"
@Herb_t45 @Croaxis_ Nobody uses the website. If billions of people used them, they would advertise on it.
"@Herb_t45 @Croaxis_ Listen. 2020 Leafy didnt get as revenue as is. Advertisers use targeted ads anyway.  Demonitization would still exist.

Advertisers advertised on YouTube for years when it was way more edgy. They only pulled out when the people go after their brand.

They literally don’t care"
@Croaxis_ @Herb_t45 Why would YouTube become more strict if 230 is removed? The point of politicians removing it is to make the website abide by free speech laws.
@lil_steamy @GabeNwah @TAwakeChristian If creators can’t sell merch, or get sponsors, then they aren’t getting enough views to make ad rev reliably. Lol
"@lil_steamy @GabeNwah @TAwakeChristian If YouTube did that, they would no longer have user generated content.

User generated content is a billion dollar industry. Someone else will hop on that train.

Lol YouTube isn’t giving up their monopoly"
@Herb_t45 @Croaxis_ I mean ads still wouldn’t show up on a leafy video. The only difference is that YouTube can’t kick him off for saying 2/10.

"@lil_steamy @GabeNwah @TAwakeChristian Also tv is dying. Literally everyone knows it. Netflix and hbo don’t have ads. Social media is the best way to reach people. 

It’s pretty obvious."
"@lil_steamy @GabeNwah @TAwakeChristian Let me explain. Creators who make their living on YouTube don’t solely survive off of ad revenue. Because ad rates are unreliable and often suck.

The idea that companies leaving (which they always come back) would severely effect creators isn’t true."
"@CReborn26 I’ve talked about an appeal cause that’s what’s being discussed by politicians.

No one has made a full blown plan yet for how to handle reworking it. So I don’t want to talk about something when I don’t know what that is."
"@Croaxis_ @Herb_t45 Cause we’ve seen advertisers pull out and come back several times. There’s too much money in social media. Don’t need to be on a board to see the obvious.

However, little to no youtubers make their living solely off of advertisement  in today’s world. So they’re just wrong."
@CReborn26 It will most likely just be updated. Can’t imagine a full repeal without something replacing it
@demisaysstuff This is a basless take. Literally what your saying the internet will become is what it already is.
@CReborn26 And nobody would deny that it was good for the time. But it’s been over 20 years. This desperately needs to be changed. These sites suck balls now.
@CReborn26 It really depends on what party gets a hold of it. If the dems get it, it could mean more restrictions. If the republicans get it, it will me a far less restrictions.
Fair. 
@FilmOddities This is literally fear mongering. You’re crazy if you think Netflix is the only thing that would exist. Literally not realistic at all
@BronzeShow This is exactly right.
"@FilmOddities The other forum was not considered liable since they did not moderate their site. 

After this case 230 was introduced allowing sites to moderate how they choose. Without ever being liable unless they directly put out the content"
"@FilmOddities I do lol it’s a very popular case that was used to decide the president over misinformation on two separate forums. 

One site was held liable due to moderating the forums. “Moderating” the users had the court interpret the site as a publisher. Making them liable."
"@mrautism6 Freedom comes with consequences. 

I’d argue that letting creators like idubbbz, filthy frank, leafy, and mumkey thrive far outweighs the consequence of lion maker being allowed to upload to his dead channel."
@FilmOddities I can’t argue with you if you don’t know what you’re talking about 🤷‍♂️
If they allow everything, they won’t be liable for the content on their site.
"This is not how 230 works. Lot of people are confused on it. 

230 makes social media companies essentially invincible.

By removing it you force them into an ultimatum:

Either censor content and risk being liable for something you don’t catch, or allow everything. "
"@FilmOddities Companies would not be held liable unless they moderate or censors users on the site. 

Once they do that, they can be held liable. 

Companies won’t want to be liable, so they’ll stop censoring users. More creative freedom for everyone."
@FilmOddities This is completely wrong.
@Guyperson654 @ericmusicfan The kinds of speech our constitution doesn’t allow would also likely be prohibited
RT @DitzyFlama : 
@ericmusicfan This is fundamentally untrue

Why do people like him exist lol 
"@ericmusicfan Yes. Only if they choose to remove user created content in the first place. 

If they don’t remove anything, then they aren’t liable and can’t be taken to court."
"@ericmusicfan Yes. If you remove the nazi stuff, you could be held liable. 

It’s either all okay, or none of is.

Freedom of speech has its drawbacks for sure. But I think the freedoms outweigh the odd random shitty person."
"@ericmusicfan @TAwakeChristian Dummy no. They only become liable if they choose to moderate their content in the first place. 

There’s a whole court case this is based on. Smh"
@Herb_t45 Advertisers do this all the time, they come back with renegotiated ad rates. Corporate America at its finest.
"@ericmusicfan Making them liable if they choose to censor content, means that they won’t censor anything. Meaning more creative freedom.

If you argue about this basic fact again I won’t respond lol. That’s what the law is."
"@ericmusicfan You don’t know what your talking about. The “host” would only be held liable if they choose to moderate their site.

If they choose to allow everything, then they can’t be held liable.

Under 230 the host isn’t held liable ever. Moderation or not."
"@ericmusicfan @TAwakeChristian The companies would only be considered as publishers if they moderate their site. 4chan would be fine. 

 As long as you don’t moderate your site, you won’t be held liable."
"@_Thudles_ 1. The only reason you use social media is because you can connect to people all around the world.

2. YouTube wouldn’t be open to a lawsuit as long as they don’t moderate their site. No censorship allowed."
"@ericmusicfan This is a fallacy. If 230 is removed, the site will only be held liable if they moderate their site. 

In short: it’s either all okay, or none of it is."
"@_Thudles_ Again, the advertisers will always come back. There’s billions of users and little to no market share.

"QnA part 3:
“But it could lead to an adpocolypes and creators will make less money!”

Lol thats already happened. Creators make most of their money off of sponsorships and merch since ads are already unreliable.

I’d rather have creative freedom than a couple extra pennies."
"It does mean that sites like Facebook and YouTube have less control over their own website. Some say that breaks the first amendment.

I’d argue that when you run a monopoly like social media sites, that the freedom of the people should be catered too more than the company. 

2/2"
"QnA part 2:
“Willy, then getting rid of 230 will mean MORE restrictions for users on the sites.”

No it won’t. Only if sites like Facebook and YouTube choose to no longer accept user generated content. There’s too much money in this. That’s nonsense. 

1/2"
"@lil_steamy @GabeNwah @TAwakeChristian Interesting seeing people who don’t make money on YouTube, talk about how there would be less money on YouTube 🤔

Billions of dollars and users on the site. Monitization will never permanently leave.

"@lastlineshow Hate speech is still illegal. You cannot make calls to violence.

Porn will likely be addressed when 230 is dismantled, seeing that the US has a very conservative view on nudity and porn.

There will probably be white supremacists and racists just like there are now on twitter."
@_Thudles_ @Leafy @SimianJimmy democrats want to get rid of it to make tighter restrictions on the content that goes out there. The republicans want to get rid of it to protect free speech.
@lastlineshow what is the most vile shit? again illegal content still wouldn't be allowed.
"@JohnSwanYT John there is very few instances of advertisers staying off the site. YouTube has had some of it's most profitable years  ever.

Why? Cause the site has an ever growing user base (thanks India!)

And because people advertize on it. It won't go away man, its total fear mongering."

"@JohnSwanYT The advertizers left because people snitched to them. They left because they knew they had the power to change the website.

If they don't have the power, then they won't be able to negotiate. They won't leave, because that's where the money is. common sense"
"@JohnSwanYT Bro you literally think this will end YouTube monitization. There's an entire history of these sites running just fine without enforcing their TOS.

But keep pretending you know what you're talking about, and then back tracking when you sound silly. lol "
@RealBWC @JohnSwanYT lol like I said. The US Government will likely allow them to keep porn off of their site since the US is very conservative when it comes to nudity.
"@JohnSwanYT lol john. I think demonitization would likely still be in place. So ads will not show up on edgy videos. 

And again the billions of people on social media won't be advertized to? Too much money to stay away.

but fear-mongering this nonsense might get you retweets."
"@JohnSwanYT John you're such know it all lol. Advertizers only left cause the WSJ snitched and got a story. 

Advertizers will come back cause they always do. Just like they existed before TOS was enforced."
"@BlameMe42049004 @JohnSwanYT @_ThePieman_ 230 effects social media platforms the most. There is no where for advertisers to go other than TV.

Billions of people use social media, advertisers will continue to advertize on sites just like they did before TOS was enforced back in 2016."
@_Thudles_ @JohnSwanYT lol you don't listen.
"@_Thudles_ @JohnSwanYT @_ThePieman_ lol they won't do that. They're a social media site. If they did that it wouldnt be social media anymore lol.

The only reason you use YouTube, Twitter, or Facebook is for the user generated content. It's the most popular form of media. Billions of users. Far greater than TV."
"@_Thudles_ @JohnSwanYT bro you clearly don't know what targeted ads are.

There are tons of ads (and targeted ads) on porn sites, but they're for sexual things. Things that you might buy if you watch porn.

There's not Pepsi ads because you probably don't want to buy Pepsi while jerking off. haha"
"@_Thudles_ @JohnSwanYT @_ThePieman_ Johns argument: The YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook will end cause there will be offensive content on it.

Mine: lol no. Everything will probably be the same with less regulations like it was 4 years ago. 

I mean one is clearly more reasonable then the other ffs."
"@_Thudles_ @JohnSwanYT have you ever wanted a cola while jerking off? Or a new fantasy football website to gamle on?

probably not. Targeted ads are what marketing teams are for. Research probably shows that porn isn't the best place to sell retail."
"@JohnSwanYT @_ThePieman_ yes advertisers will ignore the billions of people on the internet...

John. you know that companies advertized on this site before demonitization was a thing lmaooo. it ain't going anywhere bro...

the only reason ads left before is because they had the power to change things."
this idea that the internet will end cause free speech exist is the most British thing I've ever seen. lol this take is retarded. the internet will not seize to exist. 
"@JohnSwanYT 3. Advertizers will always advertize on social media. literally billions of people are on here.

4. the law will likely be reworked preventing pornography. but honestly, I don't care if there's a titty on screen.

5. Illegal content still wouldn't be allowed. You can't murde lol"
"@JohnSwanYT 1. Racist were on YouTube prior to 2017. We're all adults, we can ignore their irrelevance just like we did back then.

2. The site was around before the advertisers left in 2017. YTers made more money, and had more creative freedom."
"@JohnSwanYT lol no.

shocker. John pretending he knows the law again."
@_ThePieman_ I'm not sure. I would expect that the new rendition of the law would likely prohibit pornography from falling under this forum.
"@_Thudles_ free speech. it would literally be like it was in 2016.

There was a TOS back then. But it was never enforced until the advertisers pulled out in 2017."
"@BronzeShow I mean they still couldn't post murder. They still couldn't self harm. They still couldn't post porn. It depends on how they rework the law.

Yes. It means there will probably be some racist guy on youtube. There will probably be gun videos. 

Imo The good far outweighs the evil"
@_Thudles_ it's either all okay, or none of it is okay. I can live with that. Sites like youtube and facebook rely on users. they will not remove everyone.lmao
"However removing 230 would mean that companies are only held liable for content on their site ONLY if they choose to moderate it. Meaning that having a TOS would make them liable

Moderating it becomes a financial risk. So companies will choose to follow free speech laws instead"
"The 230 QnA:

""Companies are private, so they don't need to follow free speech.""

Yes. Under 230 companies are not held liable for user created content on their site. On top of that they choose to add things like a TOS, to enforce their rules. 1/2"
"@_Thudles_ yes under 230 companies can do that. But if you remove it, they will be held liable for content on their site ONLY if they choose to moderate it.

Moderating it becomes a financial risk. So companies will choose to follow free speech laws instead."
"In short: It's either all okay or none of it is. 

This is what the internet needs. Creators like @Leafy and @SimianJimmy wouldn't be wrongfully kicked off if this was in place.

REMOVE SECTION 230!!!

RT please. All commentators need to know about this"
230: A law that says companies are not liable for what users post to it ONLY if you moderate it. That means sites that rely on USER GENERATED CONTENT can no long use TOS to deny free speech. 
good websites suck anyway.

@inversedaniel @InternetUnwind Btw I don’t know if ads were better. I was only at like 2k subs when it happened

@Gabeasaurusrex0 Is it really that much worse than keem falsly reporting someone as a pedo with a gfuel sponsor?? Nobody should be mad at gfuel, but pointing out it’s there isn’t that different.
Is there a difference? Both guys are tackling sensitive issues with sponsors. Seems like the same thing to me
"H3: points out that g fuel is there while keem interviews a murderer, and accuses people of being pedos.

@Mistergloworm @T90Official It’s probably not legally fair use. But god damn dude, it’s social media. He’s filling a gap for an audience that’s unaccounted for. We need more aoe2 highlights!
@Mistergloworm @T90Official Literally happens all the time. Those videos are monitized and not claimed at all. Look up news fails/funny highlights
@RegularCoolDude @T90Official I don’t want to assume with T90Official, but it seems like most twitch streamers just see is lost dollar signs lmao.
Highlight videos build and share communities imo

"@ChrisRGun @Bowblax like we need specifics. Everything is so arbitrary. Dude's fine for 4 months and then one day he's dead. lol.

Like don't you want job security too?"
@ChrisRGun @Bowblax yes. if leafy got a strike once a week and actually had time to adjust his content. If he gets hit all at once that's insane and unfair.
@Smas2468 @Q_Review completely different statements. I guess i'm the only one who cares about context. it's cool. just jerk eachother off in this thread
@CBTSSpecialist the 3 normal strikes expire eventually. Leafy received all 3 of these at once.
@CBTSSpecialist warnings are a 1 time lifetime strike. I have a warning too for trying to sell a pillow. It's a BS strike that youtube won't remove because "warnings don't really matter, it's just meant to warn you for the future." Outside of the warning, you have 3 normal strikes.
@bigg_gay @Theone145268383 @a13588607 old content should be treated the same way as the leafy content cop and content vigilante videos. Take them down, but don't strike them. Because old content of course can't follow newly updated TOS.
"@bigg_gay @Theone145268383 @a13588607 1. leafy never said that. Two different statements that the internet has combined cause fuck context.

2. That video was on storyfire. not youtube. so it had no role in his banning."
"The youtube strike system is supposed to give you a single strike for each piece of TOS you broke. That way you can correct your actions.

If they give you 3 strikes at once, that's not corrective at all. should be common sense. But homie is confused"
i like how everyone knows how leafy got banned besides leafy. it's classic really 
"@Deftlie_ @Boogie2988 @bunnydelphine He didn't break TOS any more or less than the other creators on this site. The rules he broke should garner him a strike. That's how it should be 

Instead they just straight up deleted him. Everyone is cool with how youtube enforces their bullshit policies until it's you next 🤔"
@Q_Review bro he didn't say that. At least have the courtesy to show what he said. But nope. Quinton wants the free retweets 😐

"idubbbz, h3h3 give zero fucks. 

Meanwhile boogie who has been attacked by many commentary channels is still able to see the value and stand up for a guy like leafy.

@CraftComputing Contribution ID 9014
@CraftComputing Man I bought this and still waiting for it to ship.
Long story short, the system needs an overhaul and I feel every creator regardless of platform size should champion the idea of strike reform to better effect everyone on the platform.
This never was an issue for me, I can get help and I’m thankful for that. I’m worried about any creator that works hard and gets the unfortunate wrath of bot moderation. We need a better system for every creator to avoid this in the future.
I find it really off putting that unless you have the ability to raise an issue on Twitter you can have your appeals be rejected within minutes and no further recourse. The system needs a change
YouTube ended up reversing the strike a few hours later, while I expected it like this and that’s fine. I really would like to get in a talk with @TeamYouTube and help come up with ways so that this doesn’t affect smaller creators who have no recourse.
".@TeamYouTube I refuse to see how this violated scam policies when I’m clearly calling out and stopping my viewers from falling prey to these obvious issues that plague your platform and many others.

Sorry I didn’t stream the game, I usually can’t do chat and play a horror game like this. I like to really get into it and enjoy it solo
Fuck it idc, not uploading this play through in parts. Just gonna upload a fucking 8 hour edit of resident evil
@SxMango Tons of replayability. People forget these all are short games. This is a perfect mix of that classic RE puzzle formula and the action oriented resident evil 4 era of games.
RT @EmperorLemon : Modern-day e-journalists have repeatedly and overtly sabotaged YouTubers' income over petty nonsense, yet remain baffled why independent creators don't trust them.
"For anyone complaining about re8s playtime. Granted I finished the game under 8 hours but I’ve also played the entire franchise again back to back recently.

Mainline RE games are all “short”. Enjoy the game cause it’s good, not because it has a million points on the map to clear"
@expiredsoups @Da_Bomber69 Definitely better, locations are more fleshed out and the game flows a lot better moment to moment.
@Hyo_Joestar Had more scary moments than re7 for sure, one section was entirely horror oriented. This will scare you more than re2 remake
@expiredsoups @Da_Bomber69 Oh shit I didn’t know that. The game doesn’t have a timer on the pause menu so i didn’t catch that.
@Brunobb1 Just under re2 remake. A lot longer and fleshed out.
@expiredsoups @Da_Bomber69 No cutscenes skipped, died once and did all the side objectives, pretty cool, it’s a big game but if you played enough resident evil like I have you just breeze through.
Resident evil 8 village is the game
Pretty good game 
@SxMango Hell yes
@iBDWR 1st I got the second one in September
Hey hey ya boy finally got a date with a thicc vaccine :)
Let’s goooo 
@dark1x To add on top of the bullshit, in my experience the cloud save system has a limitation in the amount of saves, the system fails to upload for me since I have to many games saved to the cloud while still not maxing the file size limit. Without USB backup this is terrible.
@dark1x Wait what? You can’t backup saves on ps5 anymore? What the fuck
@KEEMSTAR I thought diversifying your portfolio was kindergarten shit lmao fuck the Internet.
Sold dogecoin
Online shitposters &gt; Traditional media
Triller h3 lawsuit thing 
Oh wow this blew up, muting replies but please check out my onlyfans “cucumberexplorations” for premium content.
We should sue Triller for hosting such a garbage event tbh.
I hate reading a viral tweet and then the creator advertising some dumb fucking projector underneath it lol
@PC98_Audi Hey man at least it’s not shenmue.
They should flag the toxic players and matchmake them only with each other I’d pay to hear the voice chat lmao. 
@SpawnWaveMedia I played yakuza 6 at 900p and still loved a great that game looked
@KJovian Final Fantasy 10
@dark1x I believe Microsoft affects this at the vm level they use to spin up these games. Pretty cool to see every enhancement they’ve been using across the board. Would be great to see this come to Xbox 360 games.
This is pretty cool 
You couldn't pay me to use their dogshit service. 
I wanna meet the people who are fucking dumb enough to fall for this shit lmao. 
@ModernVintageG Lost odyssey finally playable?
You criticize the CTO of a shady crypto group he fucking wants your dox. Fucking weirdos. 
"One of my homies came out. Dudes scared shitless to tell family cause of all the traditional bullshit.

I wish we lived in a world where people didn’t fucking care about this stuff, it ain’t a big deal ffs. I’m just pissed someone has to be miserable over this shit for real."
Nazis are gross, today I learned they’re even fucking grosser. 
Thanks babe 
"Every time I see some celebrity or social media goon pimp out a crypto scam I cry a little cause I believe in shit like Bitcoin.

All these shit crypto coins need to be taken to a sunset and see the barrel of a shotgun."
"Fuck man I’m already a year older again.

Don’t ask me my age I legit stopped keeping count."
Console war genuinely irks me. Even if I had a broken system id literally get it replaced. Using it as fuel for your plastic jihad may be the saddest shit I’ve ever seen. Fucking touch grass and get laid lmao
Holy fuck thank you god 
Goddamn Returnal fucking kicks ass
I mean watching boomers try to be funny is also a waste of fucking time. 
Thanks for giving me some of the time in your day to watch some Indian dude on the internet. I don’t really deserve it but i fucking hella appreciate all of you to the ends of the earth :)
Provisioned MutaVPN on the same host that Netflix uses they couldn’t block it if they wanted lmao.
@InternetAjay It’s a choice we both made.
Fucking resident evil village can’t come sooner goddamn.
Ratios are the dumbest fuckin concept ever invented on this website.
"For smooth brains thinking I’m defending an antivaxer. Ones cringe because she can’t wear a simple mask and the others cringe because she’s going through such an effort to shut this person down.

It’s a trainwreck that has no survivors."
Bro they put edp445 in this game lmao 
What zero penis does to a mf. 
@CraftComputing @novellahub It’s actually GNU/Linux.
Imagine running a search when you can view all the games on a single page
You can’t make this shit up lmao 
I’m proud of not sounding “Indian” lmao 
I think it’s statistically impossible to find a gaming laptop that doesn’t sound like a jet engine.
stay away from this creepy doll lmao. 
@Ninja good shit man, recently picked up the game again and im seriously trying to give it an attempt again. pretty fun with the right stack.
Looking at some cool Linux stuff regarding turning my one graphic card into four virtual ones. Will cover it more tomorrow.
@ddofinternet Running computers within computers. Kinda like the matrix
@ddofinternet You into virtual machines bro?
If you shit talk me on siege and I triple your score go suck my fat fucking cock lmao. Get carried bitch
"I’ve seen close friends have bad days like this, I’ve had bad days like this. Why is this moron recording this guy to blast on the internet. @TwitterSafety you’re seriously not going to suspend Tariq for bullying?

Guy on camera is suicidal on Reddit atm from what I’ve been told. "
@TheQuartering At least something good came out. Breaks my heart seeing that video with his breakdown. I have close friends who have done the same when pushed to their limits on a bad day.
@MorningBrew HAHAHAH LMAO
@GibiOfficial Leaving people on read
@CFCGiroud Weekend most likely
What a fucking drop in viewership lmao 
@Wendigoon8 Bout a week ago brother
Wish our buddy a speedy recovery &lt;3 
@DanielSambar Sure thing dad
Judgments a wild game 
@MoistCr1TiKaL It’s a shameful life
@TurtleCelestial Just general seeing it happen to smaller channels. They get fucking bullied
@TheRealRabi_ The system on the website needs a rework to safeguard user info in case of bad actors using it to siphon information or illegally filing claims that they have no intention of taking to a courtroom.
YouTube needs to rework the DMCA system. It take a few clicks for anyone to file a false illegal claim and stop streaming for three months and gain someone’s personal information in a few clicks. Shit needs to stop.
Fuck it all
I’m gonna tell my kids this was doomguy 
@AnisaJomha Congrats
@SpawnWaveMedia Treat yourself.
Holy shit bitclout is such a scam I can’t believe all these celebs are endorsing this shit
@PaymoneyWubby Sounds like a collab when the pandemic finally dies down.
@annandvirk For real it’s a team game, people should care about putting points up for round wins more than kills
If I can install a vm on the onboard computer it’s basically video material
Considering a hentai wrapped lambo to write off in taxes
Holy fuck dude almost died so a video could get on trending 
Minecraft Stans are proof that God left us a long time ago.

"Is the new warzone map a reskin lmao.

Still trying to get in but the servers at Activision are running on a fucking boiled potato."
Fuck it I’m gonna teach you all how to make your own VPN lmao. Tired of finding safe ones.
GTA 5 is now older than its average player base lmao
@Elliot_Coll I’m keen
@weesterner Looks sick
If you get your finance advise from tiktok investors you deserve to eat out of the dumpster.
You best know it’s Popeyes.
Motherfucker we having fried chicken tonight, treating my ass :)
We just busted Arthur Morgan what can your city brag about huh? 
@CountDankulaTV Holy shit what the fuck is even going on with these people
"This EdP445 shot makes me wanna start punching holes in my walls. Fuck these pieces of shit predators on our platform.

Go to jail and get fucking tossed around."
I’ve never saved a fucking dime using honey.
"@ddofinternet Life is nothing but the friends and experiences you make along the way. No real great cosmic answer.

We’re floating on a decaying rock together, it’s all about making the best of what we have."
YouTube ads on steroids today lmao 
"You’re forgetting how most mods are a love effort with no financial future but somehow lead games to sell many more copies just because of their existence.

Fucking literal embryonic takes from a fucking check mark lmao. "
Big thanks for the 420k followers here. I like to take long walks on the beach and shitpost on the toilet &lt;3
@ScottTheWoz I would like to be in of your projects Mr. Woz
"If some dude starts selling you a course with the words “blockchain”, “finance tips and tricks” anywhere near you.

Fucking run and keep on running."
You know I’d really like twitch to one day nail vods and video uploading and rival YouTube, only solid competitor that can exist.
This is really good goddamn news. 
Nah fuck it I’m not letting this thread get to me it’s fucking 16 and it’s too early for this shit. Fuck you twitter
Microsoft Maths is on my side for this but fuck it if you’re old like me you probably also got 1 as well. 
"The answer is 16 or 1 depending on if the person was using distributive properties. Order of Ops is whatever comes first left to right.

Better answer this is so ambiguously written that everyone in this thread is gaslighting each other.

Shit I think it’s 16 but I just woke up. "
@realranton Dude these Mexicans are using plutonium in their salsa lmao.
Mexicans are just built differently, I had some of your food and my ass still feels like a nuclear blast site.
"Nah not everyone has 60 bucks to spare every time a zombie game comes out.

Days gone wasn’t bad but this is just toxic thinking. Pick shit up on a sale homies. "
@TheActMan_YT I buy my games from steam. Asides from VR they really give fuck all about making games.
@InternetAjay This whole community is driving me insane with all this shit recently.
@JohnWolfeYT @charitywater Fucking legend
These student proctoring softwares are so goddamn invasive, how is this level of access on anyone’s computer even tolerated holy shit.
Do I dare buy the Soulja boy gaming console to rip and tear it apart?
"I’m so glad piracy exists. I fully support it when the lifecycle of a console is over, no publisher makes $ when they stop selling the product except eBay resellers.

Piracy might be the greatest tool when it comes to preserving video game’s."
I fell asleep watching that dog shit event and woke up to a seven second clip of a first round knockout. I fucking love Jake Paul dude trolled us and won holy shit.
This whole fight event makes me wish I had done the fucking tide pod challenge
One of the announcers on this fight seems to have forgot the USSR doesn’t exist anymore holy shit who the fuck greenlit this lmao.
Jake Paul owes me $50 
Okay snoop dogg and cube are saving this disaster of a “fight” ngl
This Jake Paul boxing even over triller is such a waste of $50. Literal fisher price production values and this is coming from a sleep deprived dude who films in the dark lmao.
@bestbleach1 Tried signing up, can’t since I’m not eligible but at least both my parents have it.
This new third lockdown is already wild. Hopefully Toronto gets its shit together so I’m not growing grey hairs by the time it’s finally over.
@ModernVintageG It’s so dangerously close to your own acronym lmao. But fuck I’m even done arguing over this it feels like 10 people actually care about preserving software going forward and that really saddens me.
Soon 
Where’s that fucking cyanide pill goddamnit. 
The term “cbomb” means that when the cmos battery dies on the motherboard which it certainly will at one point, without and internet connection to psn servers (imagine they go offline at some point) renders the whole system useless. Literal e waste.
This is already sounding like bad news for those who picked up the digital only ps5 
Mobile game ads really be hitting different these days. 
Fuck man I feel like I’m down bad, I want resident evil village out soon I’m itching for that tall vampire chick.
Jesus fuck my dogecoin portfolio fucking went to the moon holy shit what happened lmao.
L M A O 
I love when these messages start out with them being huge fans of me, sure thing buddy. 
Remember this is verified kfc account, the best brand account lmao. 
@DarkViperAU @TeamYouTube I hummed a song and it got picked up, it’s not just mental it’s a different fucking dimension.
Mine too babe 
This video might have a higher kill death ratio than any pro league player I’ve seen.
YouTube shorts will literally kill you lmao 
@Yuriofwind Ahh the lost odyssey life
@Kreiser_VII Holy shit lmao that’s terrible design. Never played the game but I want to now.
Kinda miss the days when we had to switch discs in video games. Felt like the biggest story ever told.
@sumitomedia Didn’t you already do that?
@ArodMarcus Nothing here is a day zero. Stuff is unpatched but I get what ya mean that’s just good practice.
"Still not banned on discord but I’ve siphoned password tokens, debunked bullshit and crashed clients.

Video tomorrow."
@ModernVintageG Unless you build your games in machine code you’re nothing but a fraud wanna be programmer.
HAHAHA STOLEN VALOR LMAO TOUCH GRASS. 
When you don't use code "SOG" 
"@sumitomedia Nah, I’m fucking around. Sometimes I do it so Adobe doesn’t crash or miss any layers for some reason. My mgs4 video I was worried about render errors.

Now when I do my big project for the month it tends to be a good safety net."
@dark1x Twitter is home to the most prime takes our species has ever heard of.
@sumitomedia I package the final edit sequence in a new project.
@SociableBarely Agreed. I think it’s shitty too we amalgamate on this one platform. At least celebs have a degree of individuality asides from all living in the same city.
Sony is being a fucking shitlord with this nonsense. It’s like they wanna forget they ever made the ps3. Thank god we have emulators for it... 
"It’s uncomfortable to see how a lot of you tubers have predator allegations, now it’s seeing all the media throw that at the entire platform.

One real negative is the guilt by association. Like it or not we all look like shit cause of a few terrible apples."
btw im so dissapointed some of you assumed this joke profile picture is gacha, bros it's fucking maplestory. no joke im sure a groomer tried messaging me on it when i was playing last night, be careful.
"As shit as some nights are it's immeadiatly made better by sitting with a hot cup of coffee and editing together a deep web video.

Thanks for giving me the opp, it's a huge reason to wake up and do something with my life that's not just a dumb grind.

Deep Web video today &lt;3"
Covering discord viruses in a couple days. If my account gets banned you know why.
@kiwi_sunset Oh yes
Fuck yeah 
I don’t think we need a remake of a game that plays pretty well and already has a remaster. Fuck it Sony can we just have SOCOM, Syphon Filter or Sly Cooper? 
I dunno how long I can do lockdown. Well over a year with no contact with anyone, no end in sight. Sorry for the bad vibes, just feels like nothing exists at the moment. I’m just really done.
Looks like I wasn’t the only one getting really high tonight :) 
@annandvirk Man that stuff is great, bought a bottle a couple years back. This makes me wanna get another.
Found this gem around my house, time really flies. Gonna turn it into a Bitcoin miner. 
RIP DMX
Who plays you in your biopic?  
@simplyloey @Loeybug 
@KavosYT Above 15 now. Ever since his apology every day people have been coming out. This shit makes all of us look bad at this point for even sharing the platform.
"How does James Charles rack up over 15 accusers. This shit is fucking disgusting bro especially when minors are so involved.

Completely unacceptable shit and the dude needs to have police intervention."
I have to appreciate how intel let’s us have just a little bit of racism if we want.
Holy shit Intel made an AI that toggles off toxicity what the fuck??? 
I know nfts are cool and all but I don’t know if I’d ever drop cash on a jpg.
@THEREALRTU @Razer @TeamRazer @YouTube Did you buy a gpu enclosure or is this a full system?
Can’t believe bird app tried to cancel Genshin impact lol
:/
@TheActMan_YT I wanna record left 4 dead 2 coop with you if you review it dad
Someone at Facebook needs to be fired for having 500 million user accounts leaked and then playing it off as if it's old data. Some accounts appear to be just a year old. I'm confident this has to be illegal federally and Facebook needs to own up to their shit. 
"I fuckin hate lifestyle gurus selling bullshit courses.

Fuck your rented lambo and Airbnb."
@YesIAmBackk Anarchy would be better for us at this point lmao
@Thafnine Clean as fuck dude
@Drift0r Fucking hell
@PoopyCatsLol It’s a video and I have some dmca strike stuff on this account so I’m not keeping media tweets until I can get that sorted out with twitter.
Girl on siege literally asked where the site was and some permavirgin asks her a bra size. Holy shit bro I’m glad to be a guy lmao. I’ll stick my cock down your eyeball if you ask me that shit in the middle of a round.
"I wanna keep enjoying rainbow six siege. But every time I fire up a casual game I’m playing with people who snort adderol wtf.

Guys we don’t need to run out every round."
@zaptiee Lack of hygiene
"Outriders is a cool game but for the love of God can we stop making games you could play solo require an online fucking internet connection?

It’s not an MMO, it’s a fucking three player looter shooter."
@Thafnine Wut??
Hey @PlayStation if I offer you my booty will you give bloodborne a 60fps patch?
@holychwan All n gage users we’re certified virgins. I consider that a plus.
@Yuriofwind It’s a step up from 5 fps chaos theory
I’m a proper console warrior. I’ll fight tooth and nail for the good old n-gage any day.
God can someone please just fucking ratio me.
@GlinkLive A fair amount depending on how you conceal your browser fingerprinting on the pc.
Today I learned the FBI is investigating limp dicked losers on counter strike for fixing matches lmao
@Regalbruh This is a Sony exclusive since the ps2 days and is a big deal for sports gamers. Now it’s popping up cross platform and on game pass day 1.
Holy shit this is kinda massive, fucking game pass is killing it lol 
I think I’m gonna get laid bros. This is getting real &lt;3 
@GFuelEnergy I want
@krisstraub At least two months
@LrdHighSummoner Same here. Grew up all over the Internet
I deleted all the vms
Patch 1.2 on ps5 wont load the world for me 
@sweetanita :)
I’ll buy a tubbycoin 
@KempMou7 I’m not. I just think in terms of how we Canadians have handled it is fucked up. Our gov can’t even enforce basic lockdown rules and our vaccines are far behind. We’re like a literal fourth world rn
@UwU_face_ Sorry fuck I just read that. I’m really pissed tonight after reading that thread. Whole life has come to a stop because of this. I haven’t seen family properly in over a year.
@UwU_face_ It’s how we spell it in countries not named the “United States of America” you embryo.
"James Charles is an incredibly irresponsible creator using his platform and constantly involving himself with minors. Tons of legal cock out there and yet this manchild keeps fucking up.

Shits inexcusable."
Dude I could make a tutorial on how to install minecraft on your moms vibrator and you can’t tell it’s a scam now lmao. 
@YouTube We don’t need this feature. Dislikes help in identifying problems in content/creator. Shit I use my own dislike gauge to identify how a video is treated.
Giving cyberpunk a replay after the big patch they released. Expectations are set super low rn. 
"I don’t see the big deal with Satan shoes from lil nas x, like most things I don’t agree with on the internet I move on with my life.

Regardless tho I’m still wondering who’s blood was mixed into the shoe however."
Smell one first and tell me you’d say the same thing twice. 
@sumitomedia Videos suck ass her vagina looks like minecraft portals
@nBurd_ I’m down
@Yuriofwind Thanks brother ;-;
"You ever record an amazing fucking video and at the end when you feel good about notice the camera was never set to record.

Yeah me too..."
@Loeybug Lmao hahaha what a brainlet
@KreekCraft Good shit brother
Wholesome victory royale of the day. 
Looks like everyone’s about to miss the panty raid lmao 
@JohnWolfeYT I loved the ending section of this game a lot
@MoistCr1TiKaL Onion rings better
@XanderhalTV This cancellation shit is happening every six hours. It’s the new crack cocaine
Quick psa very important 
@ShadyTricertops I’ve been longswording most of my career, think I’m about to try hammer this time.
I’d make a video but I’ll save that for tomorrow cause monster hunter rise has me by the balls
@realranton Yes
"I think about all the progress we made as humans. Engineering, medicine, Arts and soon space travel one day. Yet for some reason we look and define people based on uncontrollable features.

It’ll change but we gotta put in the effort. Nothing matters until we come together."
"I hope one day before I’m dead people learn to come together regardless of race and affiliation. It’s depressing to keep reading the news and timelines day after day seeing the divide.

I think about it a lot and hopefully it all gets better, in the end all we have is each other."
@annandvirk I hope it’s just pre alpha because unless this game captures old school rainbow or swat 4 it’s a bargain bin title
I should clarify I firmly bet my left testicle that @Dream didn’t say that word.
If @Dream bought the @twomad n pass he wouldn’t be getting cancelled.
@annandvirk I wanna just have a morally questioning tactical shooter with AI that keeps me on my feet as I’m clearing rooms.

Update she was fired one hour ago by Reddit execs after claiming to not properly background check.
"Why Reddit thought it was a good idea to hire and defend someone with two people close in her family who are so open about pedo fantasies is beyond me.

Really stupid shit but unsurprising cause this is the same site that defended the jailbait subreddit."

@InfernoOmni bro im all in that game, it's pulling no punches.
@YourBudTevin with that XP gain I'll grind my eyes out.
I wish I had more time to put into JRPGs, growing up as a kid grinding to level 99 before assfucking the final boss is what I miss the most.
@YujaPlusOne I'd only expect a copy of Danganronpa Trilogy as payment and nothing else and so far I'm sitting without Danganronpa :(

@PhillyD Deus ex
@Slasher Skype still goes strong for people out of the discord loop. I think it’ll go well considering discord is gonna be self sufficient at this point post acquisition
The story of #Sex2 is amazing but I feel the gameplay was personally inferior to the original when you added more than two players to the party.
Should I fly my ass to Texas? 
"Before anyone cancels me on the tone indicators I’m just giggling about them looking like legit 4chan threads.

It pisses a lot of losers off if you use them for no reason so keep doing it. It’s two letters and if it helps someone out telling a joke go for it."
All my tones are /r from now on
Someone said I should use tone indicators on this site and all I have to say is why do they all look like 4chan threads lmao.

@FredInTheKnud @MoistCr1TiKaL Vouch
Further clarification cause of the character limit. I don't condone this unprofessionalism but I would say this is on the same level of what rock stars do with groupies. I don't agree with it but this isn't predatory behaviour like Twitter is hiveminding over.
"The more I look into these Game Grump allegations the more I'm leaning on that this is unprofessional behaviour.

Messaging someone at 18, then meeting them at 22 when 30 and having sex isn't pedophilia. I hate people who throw that term around so willingly."
Fuck bro these new game grumps allegations are hitting pretty hard :(
Onlyfans would go bankrupt. 
I’m actually so triggered by this comment I’m gonna review Deus ex and fucking make you look install it.
@punjablpower Tons of options to attack each objective, real proper role playing and a kickass story and world to explore.
I quit youtube 
Last few posts people got questions if I’m gay or something. Bro nothing wrong with playing on the same team here and there I guess. Figure I should just say something. &lt;3
@SociableBarely Yes

@annandvirk Yeah we’re all cringe
I just want final fantasy 7 part 2
I found the second coming of Jesus on Reddit. Video tomorrow babe
Full context dude is just joking on stream peep the smirks toward the end.
I swear this dudes sarcasm is off the fucking charts. 
Btw it’s fucking brain dead to steal iPhones. The things are server locked to iCloud so you’re literally sitting with an unusable product that pings your location once you connect it back to the Internet.
I had an alright day I guess. 
Cyberpunk 2077s response to fixing the police system was literally spawning them a bit further away lmao 
Uploading a video about spanking valorants anti cheat. It’s kind of like virus investigations lmao
Fucking sleep paralysis is coming back daily again :(
Dudes battery is on 1% for the last 50 years. 
@BasedStudMuffin I’m kinda surprised casual matchmaking has this much sbmm and it’s making me not want to pick up this years cod. They have ranked but barely push it which I think is the big problem.
@BasedStudMuffin It’s taken so much fun out of the game now that I have to sweat each game
@FortniteR870 Agreed. Still I wish it didn’t happen at the rapid pace it has I’m starting to get surprised at how many people their are doing this shit
"I think everyone on the David dobrik situation is just kind of a piece of shit tbh.

Fucking hate these stories on YouTube of people even allegedly doing heinous shit. It’s so fucked."
@TheActMan_YT It’s still wild. I can’t find a store in my area that’ll even do walk in purchases. It’s all online which sucks.
Three years is nothing for the kind of risk he opened people up to tbh, fucking loser lmao 
"I was on Grindr and it told me about all the anti Asian hate going on.

From the bottom of my heart please stop falling into the pits of hating people for shit they had no control over."

I fucking hope aliens kill us all sometimes. 
This new rainbow six siege season slaps uwu
@TeamYouTube Appreciate the response. I’ll watch the language going forward in that regard.
Can update sizes chill the fuck out. Feels like I’m sitting installing patches more than playing games lmao.

Once again @TeamYouTube how does this video contain any sexual or nudity for which it was turned 18+ for?

@punjablpower I’m hoping it’s live service but playable off the disc offline. I hate online only live service shit.
@punjablpower I’m hyped, the latest screenshots looked great. I’m sure it’ll be a banger I just wanna continue the story.
@IndoorSitup Been rocking halo 2 anniversary and 3.
I’ve spent the last 48 hours addicted to halo multiplayer and I just wanted to let you know the first step was admitting I have a problem.

I think I fell down a Chinese state run propaganda YouTube rabbit hole. Lemme kill my brain cells first and I’ll make a video babe.
@kiwi_sunset It’s a big problem. Once I reached 25 it magically went away.

Let’s be real Pepe le pew was hella fucking weird.
@SubToOptimus I forgive you man
@HuggbeesTV Let’s start a jihad against Covid bro
@exe_waffle Those are hackable systems. PS5 doesn’t have any hacks running on it atm. Even if they did the firmware would update and you would be required to give up hacks to play online.
@TsukiiiVAL Nothing can stop dossing unless you VPN and hide your IP. As long as you have your IP publically anyone can dos you.
Why does a console need anti cheat tech when you can’t run modified code on it to begin with? Seems pointless as their aren’t true hackers on a console asides from people using keyboards and mice on unsupported games. 
@InfernoOmni When are the hedges putting a hit out lmao
GameStop stock is surging again wtf is happening.
@girlfromcanada Don’t gaming publications pay you for articles written?
Dude this is so terrible for mature channels. Twitch literally made their version of the Chinese social credit system. 
It grows taller everytime you use code “SOG” at GFuel. 
@L1nko64 I don’t enjoy any company buying out like this. what we’re seeing is the true monopolistic origins of Microsoft play out. It’s a shame too because in the video game industry their technically not a monopoly but they’re the only ones with the cash reserves to pull these deals off.
"Sony needs PlayStation to be successful year after year which I hope they are. Microsoft doesn’t care if Xbox flips a profit at all since they care about having high numbers to show in game pass subscriptions.

They don’t even care if you use an Xbox to game."
"People who fight console wars keep comparing Microsoft to Sony as equals.

MS doesn’t care about 7 billion to buy a company for a few IPs, they print money by being one of the biggest tech firms in the world.

What matters is Xbox doesn’t waste ownership of what they bought."
@BurgerKingUK what’s the number to the based dept?

@RealYungCripp Warriors remaster on the new engine would be a banger
Man fuck gta6 I just want manhunt 3
@neekolul Checking it out :)
@gardiner_bryant This error is odd. If it’s VFIO the card should just blank but it seems like it’s reattaching to the host OS which shouldn’t happen. You should still get that reset bug on mainline kernel but no reason to crash the kernel. Are you running your vm in user space or in system?
@gardiner_bryant Is it single gpu pass through?
@gardiner_bryant This is why I stopped Firefox and switched to brave. Somethings off on Google based sites
Gonna be real I’d rather watch a relaxing livestream than a creator who snorted lines and now won’t shut the fuck up about that double kill they got on warzone. 
YouTube’s pretty based lately. 
I know the first one is deviantart soft core, I don’t really care about the redesign I wasn’t jacking off to a cartoon rabbit to begin with.
Damn dog this new generation can’t be furpilled anymore. 
Walmart and Best Buy have literally no online store protections. My friend tried to buy a ps5 the moment they got restocked but instead he took a good old fashioned dicking

I hope one day we can be rid of the plague that is this operating system. Fuck windows 10 and it’s mother."
@ModernVintageG I swear I wonder if the reason is so big is to use uncompressed assets to give the old cpus breathing room. But that doesn’t explain the next gen Cold War releases being so big then, it’s really dumb.
"Man this is just depressing at this point, hopefully this game gets updated to a playable degree with restored features.

Till then yakuza like a dragon exists and I highly recommend you pick that up and have a good old time. "

@LrdHighSummoner If I’m out I will you my rtx 3090
I hope I get to go home today.
I managed my first walk to the bathroom after surgery. Gonna tackle the wing after breakfast :)
I just found out some moron put gorilla glue in their hair, how can you be this fucking dumb lmao
Update. Surgery was a success. We had a risk of my body “cocooning” but the surgeon removed the appendix and all the gunk. Laying in recovery. They’ll start training me on fluids tomorrow.
Emergency room getting my tests 
@KEEMSTAR Btw lawyer tells me to remind you I’m not a finance expert
@KEEMSTAR This mans just mad he missed $doge
“Pls... you deserve it... just pls” 
Covid test came back negative this is a viral that’ll go away whenever it wants to fuck off. Like relatives you hate to see.
Little update. Fever fluctuates from 98 in the morning to 103.9 right now. I think I’ll break it cause I have too. Don’t worry we’re still miles away from my brain cells cooking and leaving me a tiktok dance channel.
Health update hit a high score of 101.9 celsius on the body temperature. Hopefully it’s not Covid. Head fucking hurts tho.
Even YouTube fucks with the inflation porn. 
Remember the time a cult infiltrated 4chan and caused some members to have severe mental problems and end up hospitalized? Video tomorrow.
I’ve never been this sick. If I’m dead in the morning we had a kickass run and I’ll tweet about how boring the afterlife is without you bitches &lt;3

I feel kinda bad for selling GameStop stock, honestly seeing the blood spilled by hedge funds is worth losing millions
Goddamn it im feeling sick
"Fucking @RobinhoodApp just fucked over the average person buying stock on the market and still let the billionaires have their fun. The game is fucking rigged from the start.

Hope you secured the gains."

I can’t wait For the stock market to open this morning.
Ya love to see it 
Hey hey thanks YouTube babe &lt;3 
The only difference is the stock manipulation isn’t happening with the billionaire hedge funds behind the shadows. Now they’re fighting Redditors with too much time to spare. 
@Jack_Septic_Eye Take your time. Sorry for your loss man.
Wall Street billionaires losing their shit on Twitter after today’s GameStop surge has me fucking dying. Losing well over $8 billion in a day has to hurt.
I’m gonna become the first Indian vtuber  now

My favourite bug of the year.

Fuck me I’ve slipped down a new rabbit hole. BRB going full sigma. 
I think it’s unfair for one creator to get striked while others walk away with no issue. If this is truly an issue I would prefer @TeamYouTube to pass the strikes to everyone or make sure diesel patches gets overturned his video was advocating against harming minors.

Man these are tragic trends, strangling yourself with a belt I don’t even know how that becomes a “trend” but heart goes out to the family. Idk how one can blame tiktok when the dicks who started this trend should be the ones called out specifically.

I really hope since @Twitter is on their little ban spree, can they put just five minutes of effort and shut down this disgusting hashtag used to sell child exploitation for over a year? 
@CFCGiroud If they play it smart a few grand every month I’d say.
This dude took a 10 second laugh clip and got 600k TikTok followers. Follow your dreams kids anyone can do it. 
It’s turning out day after day that the massive solar winds hack turned out to actually be Russian intelligence agents and it goes beyond just Solwarwinds. Shits insane.

@CommentCopped What an actual troglodyte.
To add beyond the character limit, you really shouldn’t get involved with fans like this due to the power dynamic and if photos are sent in this age range it’s something that should never have happened.
@KavosYT we’d get sued by the second episode but it would be great.
"This is fucked up. How long is it till the Internet realizes to wait for a response and from what I’ve seen a two year age gap between two people shouldn’t brand someone as a “pedo”. Tons of high school relationships would have ended in handcuffs.

On YouTube you should just stick to yourself completely and avoid any risk of cancellation I swear.

@realDan203 @DDXofficial @Get_Flanked No if they really gave a shit they’d check for proper VM exits but instead they wanna ban as many as they can and actually fluff up the numbers to sell more of their anti cheat.
@realDan203 @DDXofficial @Get_Flanked It took five minutes to bypass their VM checks, they’re not doing anything to stop real hackers.
@Get_Flanked Dude these peoples anti cheat is so fucked they blanket banned VMs and It takes five minutes to bypass their checks. If you wanted to inject hacks it’s easier than breathing.

@xolastlife yes
@seemsindie @ModernVintageG you know hes gonna fix one compile error and like 10 others are gonna spark up. I hope the best for anyones sanity.
@Thafnine I’ll play uno lemme come home from the war first
@dangelno You should tell this to my city. They don’t care lol
I miss the days of creators starting beef over a game of modern warfare 2 tbh
@ModernVintageG I hate debugging

@TheActMan_YT Man I need to replay this masterpiece
It’s fucking insane we’re all living through a historical moment of human history right now.
KFC getting cucked 
@CallMeCarsonYT You’re cute
@CordWit Good work man :)
I love seeing people get bigger on YouTube. This year I’ve seen tons of creators hit big milestones this shit year. I hope 2021 has big things for all of us.
sorry need to update on "exact", investigating numerous mods that provide ip info, some are providing postal codes and some aren't, really a mixed bag atm.
@BadBroBuster @RockstarGames as far as I know the game is still p2p on each console so IPs are still logged, game has no form of dedicated servers at all.
"working on a follow up to the GTA Online video today, the game is a literal free for all when it comes to security, use a VPN when you sign onto Los Santos, modders know your exact location and can keep records of it.

BTW @RockstarGames has let this happen for years."

@shoe0nhead What the fuck
All of the beautiful places to see in Mexico and some loser is gonna pick VidCon lol
@largersizeman i really like Ghosts of Tsushima, i just feel the first part of the ff7 remake really captured Midgar, the visuals, music and redefined gameplay is a great step forward for the whole final fantasy franchise and I love seeing it as i'm a huge ff fan.
@iNabber69 when we're cashing our retirement checks.
man ff7 remake was the best game of 2020 imo
Bitcoin :)
@nicholasdeorio I’d love it but Nintendo would find a way to auto level your starter to 100 before the first gym.
I will never play a match of siege with voice chat again holy fuck.
@OpTicStudMuffin Make money and buy shit to make you more money. I’d recommend investing into the new sub it unlocks a new heist that you can do solo and make some really good starter cash
Who’s dick at Twitter do you have to suck to get verified. I’m seeing 30 follower accounts hit the check mark lol

@KEEMSTAR Hackers
Merry Christmas homies
@GFuelEnergy Anal juice
@JadynIsBanned I think they're beneficial when they're live for your channel, it just looks gross having multihour long stream VODS with your edited content.
@eddyready2020 ya
btw I saw the "family guy" video I made hit 100k likes and I told you I'd make an onlyfans and I'm a man of my word so I'll make it when I get some free time next week.
"for anyone asking about the newest video being private, those are stream VODs that I private cause they're like super huge videos. 

I wish YouTube streaming had a separate tab for streams and videos so it looks more presentable going forward, would be awesome for creators."
@OMGLove Also stop overcharging for it at coffee shops cause you think it’s fancy
Gonna stream today. Tomorrow you guys get a bit of a virus investigations as we get to look at the greatest cyberattack in human history.

Holy shit man this Nintendo leak is wild. Dudes were running investigation ops on people home brewing the 3DS lmao
@HopelessFusion I got some work tonight, need to pull an all brighter unfortunately.
You guys deserve a lot more than $600
@annandvirk in a way yeah they were wanting to see the return on the investment, unfortunetly CD projekt red told them the console versions ran great, so lack of communication and honesty had investors push, i would suppose had they seen the state of the game they'd hold back.
@annandvirk They lied to shareholders unfortunately
if this twitter account gets banned cause i get one more dmca strike i honest to god don't care, it's been a good run lol
@OMGLove You as well
@ModernVintageG Yeah smart, that’s an easy DMCA.

I wish I could get a mr beast burger but I live in third world Canada :(
@DDsulzbach Roblox terrorists lol
I am pissing and shitting myself. 
@kaan_ozzy On ps4/ps5 system storage should give an exact amount, I believe Xbox unfortunately totals the overall save size of all saves combined so you may not get the exact reading there.
@inversedaniel It even saves like a ps2 game
Keep the save files under 8 MB buckle otherwise your cyberpunk adventure comes to an end lol 
i want night maps back in Rainbow Six Siege for real. Come on Ubisoft make a wish today &lt;3
@z2rMC way more script kiddie then that.

@Widnezz @Slasher pretty good man, couple more months and i'll have my dream house.
@_gbryant only until you hit debugging.
@Slasher they paid the dude on fiver to finally code a chat filter.
@ModernVintageG I think infinite was more finished lol. But after cyberpunk I’d handle all the delays ever. Excited to see what rockstar does this gen.
What the fuck lol

All I got was pyro is a furry. Pretty cool I suppose.
@rickyberwick I’m buying the shirt lol
@kiwi_sunset I think it’s a fine game, got it running smooth on my system and I hope when it comes back out PlayStation homies actually enjoy it as much as we did.
"Holy fuck Sony removed cyberpunk from the store. Good because the game is unplayable to a majority of its username.

Hopefully the game gets reworked, retooled and shipped out the way it should have been shipped."
I’m glad to have met a lot of awesome creators this year :)
If you didn’t know Roblox has a new hacker group hijacking the website, be ready I’m not even kidding.

Thank you Twitch for taking a very level headed response. "
Damn dude pc parts getting so pricey I’m putting my kidneys and testicles up for sale bro.
Fuck man I spent a whole day on GTA 5 and I’m still impressed how pretty Los Santos is :)
@BharataGiovan I hate the community but I am kinda addicted to the grind with all the gameplay content in GTA online.
New GTA online heist and I’m fucking ready. Stream?
@AntonisKazou Maverick/Montagne
Rainbow six siege has me addicted again
@TheActMan_YT Thanks man :) I loved your Cold War vid.
"@TheActMan_YT Game devs are some seriously underpaid passion project fellas. I think the lack of unionization and proper pay is somewhat reflective of a culture that doesn’t value time management very well like other software fields.

Most dev studios need a restructure going forward."
@Jake766671 So to recuperate dev costs they would release and unfinished build and sell it deceptively to a group of people, even with your scenario they should have cancelled past gen versions and released on the next gen like dying light did.
I swear to God people defend a gaming company more than its own fucking shareholders in 2020 lmao
@Jake766671 If it’s designed for ps5 and series x why are the discs printed for the last generation system and the game originally launching in April before next gen was a thing?
"I enjoy the game but you deserve the shit for deliberately hiding the footage of the base versions.

Hopefully next time this can be avoided but I refuse to believe you had minimal understanding of how bad this game ran when you printed it to discs. At least refunds are offered. "
Holy shit pornhub literally deleted unverified content that contained illegal shit not because they should have but because fucking visa and MasterCard decided to gangbang them lol

Thin Tillis and the recording companies can eat a mossy asshole for even thinking about jail time for violating dmca while you stream holy shit we gamers need a PAC 
@PaymoneyWubby @YouTube Just start doing naked yoga bro make some educational content &lt;3

"@realranton I always theorized if we can use ray tracing data as a way to create realistic field of view cones for npcs and use that to calculate cops in the vicinity of areas to investigate with this new tech.

Cops realistically hear gunshots near them and investigate."
@realranton Bro every npc just spawns around you. I think honestly rockstar does wanted systems the best in games.
@FluxWild1y What’s the size of his hog tho?
@RealYungCripp It’s more disabled than you bro
when it works it works man, the wait is over and I'm just glad to be ripping a bike through the highway I waited almost a decade to witness. 
@HuggbeesTV Can you share a screenshot of the fireworks that pop out on the YouTube studio that makes me smile :)
Don’t worry doom eternal you won an award in my books my little pogchamp &lt;3
@Alex_ftw_456 Did nothing but give me maybe 5 more fps on avg regardless of the setting
"Can someone tell me how to hit a playable FPS on cyberpunk I’m avg like 45 FPS on an rtx 3090 and i9-9900k and I’m under 4K

No matter what setting I’m getting the same frames. Going to low gives me 58fps avg. what the fuck"
This dude has a 5.7 million follower account and even his mom won’t like his tweets.

Ghosts of Tsushima? 
Man the base version of cyberpunk 2077 on base ps4/Xbox one feels like you’re Mr. Magoo losing a bar fight.
@JoshJayDaC  :)
@TheTwoon You are cute bud
Good afternoon you cute fuckers &lt;3
Night everyone that was a fucking great cyberpunk stream we had half a million playbacks on it and the prologue fully complete.
@Boogie2988 Didn’t you get it for PC shit unlocks in less than an hour.
Fixed my graphic card! Fuckers slapped an over clock on it right on the card I had to flick the switch the size of a mouse dildo to make it work but I did it
Lol can’t stream I think gpu is dead :(
@tamtom_1 I have a streaming review copy on PC
The turrets i mentioned that were indestructible on top of the “tower” segment are completely missing from the original build, they are introduced in patch 1.02 as a way to gate story progression I believe. If you delete the game and reinstall on Xbox/ps you can play normally.
"I’m gonna have to give the massive fucking 180 IQ move.

The original 1.0 code on the disc is buggy but totally playable after I deleted the game on ps5 and reinstalled.

CD Projekt Red seems to have patched the game before release to prevent story progress and spoilers LOL"
@SkillUpYT I hope 120fps modes become a standard on shooters. Some type of feature at least it’s amazing on cod
@Field_Agent_R @Lil_Jallee No the disc is the copy of the game that went gold and was sent to be certified by Sony/microsoft as playable from start to end credits. Not a license key specifically
@Lil_Jallee The day one patch is irrelevant. CDPR have shipped an unplayable game on disk which goes completely against console certifications. You cannot complete the game that was shipped on the disk
@xQc @CyberpunkGame Just fucking take my copy I’m done
@KiwiArkangel Ill be streaming it launch on PC with full maximum settings
@El_Cilantro Not in the goddamn tutorial that’s for sure, I skipped it cause that soft locked me
@SPARTANGAMER021 It does have a wanted system yes.
@OddSpecimenn Yeah, I expected nothing more than refined open world Deus ex and that’s what you get.
"As pissed as these bugs can make me, several hours into cyberpunk and the best review I can say is it feels like a much more expansive and open world Deus Ex: Human Revolution.

If you loved the Deus Ex games you’ll love this. Don’t expect GTA."
I just want to clarify, CD Projekt RED didn’t ask me to take down the video, dmca law isn’t allowing me to show you material before embargo dates.
@rickyberwick I’d rather be banned, man this shit pisses me off a lot. Fuck this fucking game
Sorry guys and gals apparently I can’t show footage of game breaking bugs. Pray to god the tutorial is fixed on launch day. I’m gonna uninstall this and play sackboy
I’m gonna just say this is a dog shit excuse. I’m looking at a game breaking bug in the tutorial. The version you print should be play-tested for at least the first 30 minutes I would hope. 
"Btw guys our merch went live today and I had it featured on our newest video, please check it out :)

"
@DrInanisVitae I did as well
The wait comes to an end 
@InfernoOmni They straight needed to add cutscenes on launch day I remember
"Cyberpunk pre patch is rough as hell. I honestly wish when these games go gold they are truly playable from start to finish without super game breaking bugs.

I know a day one patch is needed but this practice needs to called out and games can’t be printed this rough by any dev."
Stans are really gross
Bro someone’s out making Minecraft sex tapes with me laughing on tiktok lol wtf 
Further context regarding recent allegations floating in the community. You should always maintain your distance and if you know a fan or someone is underage you need to back off. Seek help if you’re attracted instead of making the gravest mistake and harming a kid in the process
It’s just so easy to not groom kids over the internet, why do so many creators fuck this up I swear.

Whoever made picture captchas needs to be taken to a nice sunset and shot.
bro the guy who was in the hunger games is in a new movie 😱😱😱 
@HuggbeesTV @MoistCr1TiKaL jesus christ this is great
@nektworks Reset bug has a patch I've been using on custom kernels that sort it all out for a while. I'm sure they'll have it fixed for RDNA2 but community patches have been made.
At this point ya boy is defecting from team green after all these years, heading over to the AMD side all the way I think, new build and I'm gonna prob make a new video on it.
Shocker, the 7 RTX 3070's on the market we're sold out before they went live, what a fucking joke.
i didnt get the scalped rtx but holy fuck can i preorder these new amd cards.
@pokimanelol mario party?
"giving death threats to a game developer cause they delayed a game by 21 days is fucking top tier derangement. cancel your fucking preorder and seek help.

the game will be out and you'll get it in due time, i know it sucks but use that time to play something in the backlog."
Seriously thank you for all this everyone. It means the world to me that we hit the magical number. 
gonna stream this bucko on twitch in an hourish and a half when its installed and ive done the tutorial if yall are down. 
virus investigations time baby 
Found this on my reddit board, be honest who the fuck got the artist at the infographics show to do this lol 
i uploaded my gamer montage at like 5 am and you guys still watched it wtf i love u. 
@TeamYouTube serious issue here. you gotta check out channel "c1rinq". appears to be a new cat killing thing. 
i gotta take a break sometime next month. my body is actually really killing me (pain points everywhere) and i need some time away for a bit. im gonna shut down if i keep going at the pace im going. sorry but im gonna take a break for a while starting next month.
@ReadytoglareYT i miss a day of work and i feel like absolute shit.
@MoistCr1TiKaL Charlie and the Phallic Factory.
i think im about to just buy a new gpu from a scalper. fucking cant find one and even the refresh i signed up for at every store has fucked me.
@THEREALRTU The Yakuza dragon engine is noturiously unoptimized on any device and this has been common knowledge for a while. a developer can choose to output 480p on the series x if they choose and its not the systems fault if the dev cannot optimize their game engine at all.
"being totally real just overlaying text on someones clip isnt exactly ""fair use"".

as much as i hate seeing someone get dmca'ed you really didnt do anything to help a lawyer convince a judge this will be fair use. "
@KavosYT BMW M4 is pretty spicy idk how that got through TOS.
@nicholasdeorio yeah, i enjoyed both game but recently @JeremyPenter did a video showcasing the recruit everyone feature and its pretty indepth so ive been looking forward to it.
"Even if Im excited for Cyberpunk 2077 beyond belief I'll wait the extra 21 days if the dev really needs them.

In the meantime we have Yakuza 7 and Watch Dogs to chew through so no biggie."
fuck me 
"if the RIAA actually gave a shit about music artists they'd provide some sort of portal to easily and fairly license music for streaming.

They only care about the big bucks they'd earn on a court case against Amazon to pocket for themselves. Let's be fucking real here."
@StenosSunborne dude its sounds like morse code lol
dude editing this temple os video is tough Terry Davis says the n word every 5 seconds holy shit.
i just woke up man getting closer to playing watch dogs legion i cant wait :) :) :)
@Fall_Espio ps3 complete edition, wanted OG music.
loaded up a new save game of gta iv lets goooooooooooooooo
RT @BikiniBodhi : Fallout 4 is fun 
I'm happy to see @Corpse_Husband trend on my twitter TL vs the usual political garbage.
having sex with minors is illegal and it shouldn't be a fantasy for fucks sake. 
"i just woke up to my brother @SubToOptimus hitting one million subs on YouTube.

Congrats my guy :)"
trump*
the person who runs Donald trumos youtube channel is gettin real comfy with the emojis... 
@joe_benno01 im farming
i can't stop playing minecraft i should get something done lol
i have an among us hack video today, deep web is tommorow because I did have a recordong bug that I can fix but it will take a minute.
"woke up to losing a long time work contract due to covid-19. ill be fine but these lockdowns have absolutely crippled the world econ and I really worry for how ppl affected will make ends meet cause of this.

i feel if we had done better in Canada maybe it would've been better."
im baffled Twitch hasnt implemented a setting to make VODs private. it would allow streamers to keep DMCA violating clips and download them later for editing and at least preserving years of content. no excuse for such a basic feature.
@JustinWhang i watched it and now im radicalized
@iNabber69 you could be indian, count those blessings.
fuck antivirus but someone should help extract him out of prison he needs a break. 
uwu i just woke up and am ready to take on the world.
@sonic_hedgehog tails doll omg omg omg
"@ModernVintageG i assume they try a vsync patch since I believe this was common to do on that era of console gen.

however you have some cases where you hardcode the FPS into the engine and in that case all I can assume is a memory/runtime patch to force/interpolate the game to 120."
@Evanz111 ive seen some of these posts. then its conflicted with posts from @digitalfoundry and @LinusTech
is sony really not handing out early review units for publications?
"then lets have any company that prefers your method of compensation let the community know and we can choose not to record/stream the game. I'm sure tons of AAA publishers will line up for this.

we can see the sales afterwards. "
Objective: Survive 
@annandvirk no hotas yet, in the market for one actially.
@annandvirk yes, it'll total the memory but you'll be clocked to the lowest speed out of the two sets.
installing elite dangerous again lets get addicted i hope.
link me the best pcvr headsets for this pls?
"could i roomscale my office with VR and recreate it in minecraft then output video of my systems to an ingame monitor and just work while i have a lava volcano next to me and have it ray traced?

ill spend ferrari money if i have to dw."
@rickyberwick now we can truly call you disabled.
Bro i found my room in minecraft wtf?? 
creative director for soon to be dead Google Stadia doesnt understand the sales effect that video game streaming has brought to the market. 
they did my boy dirty 
this retweet system is ass.
i cant believe i wont be able to watch my awesome quibi content while im shitting anymore :(
Million dollar ideas. 
I woke up in minecraft tonight
i swear having a checkmark is a curse. 
@Bowblax @AugieRFC i like when we're imposters
i agree, i went to the bank the other day and paid off my house with all the exposure I earned over the years. 
kinda weird seeing politicians running twitch lobbies lol. 2020 has its ups.
RT @JustinWhang : This stream clip video probably has my favorite thumbnail I've made  
man did twitch just get DMCA gangbanged?
spanked that among us lobby two wins as imposter.
@joe_benno01 @twomad hope they win, someone will have a vod brother :)
"gonna start streaming in like 10 minutes , getting coffee.

streaming among us with @twomad and friends."
"@CyberpunkGame i like video games and I would love to review this game. ill sell my soul in an nda if i have too.

hell if you want me to augment myself ill do that too."
"they really put unskippable ads in a $60 2K sports game.

please. stop. buying. this. trash."
fuck it for the price of the iPhone the foldable Samsung looks kinda amazing.
i think im switching to the iphone side.
spanish kfc just built differently. 
"I can only imagine somewhere some Toronto mobsters are sitting down filing out paperwork and dreaming what handgun they're gonna go pickup with tax dollars lol.

this is a shitty article tho but that's what the Toronto Sun usually is. "
@JustinWhang still pretty tired no lie i cant go back to sleep
"i reinstalled battlefield 4 again and man tons of people still on ps4.

it genuinely feels like a game that holds up so well today and still outshines a lot of crap thats come out in the shooter space. we need a proper battlefield in the modern/vietnam stage again."
@kiwi_sunset IM DOING GREAT HBU?
IM AWAKE
i use arch btw 
satanic furries are a ok for YouTube boyos. 
@Gusbuckets 
lol no 
I mentioned my dad once on YouTube and the manual review found a slur in it :( 
We got a spicier Deep Web browsing uploading in the next hour. 
i need an end to this stalker problem and the law isn't the biggest help.
probably kind of like a setup tour of my linux system and vm setup so i can show you why i use a ton of them.
virtual machine video out tommorow, you guys memed on me too hard :O
@OMGLove can i have my copy of sonic 06 back already.
"This is why we should be against this whole MAP community. these people are fucking pedos through and through, the final stage is always when they go to far like this.

shits disgusting and if you consider yourself a MAP, go seek some help. "
@kiwi_sunset @HuggbeesTV goddamn it i spit my morning coffee lol
@HuggbeesTV my trunk
i feel like im about to get groomed on this app hold my beer. 
i still cant believe i made a 4 hour and 20 minute long video this year something is wrong with me.
@VitoGesualdi first you have to get the console thats rarer than the holy grail.
"@softiiiee no its a game mode where you have to kill people and pick up their tags to increase your score.

the guy at the bottom of my board got 16 kills but only confirmed five costing us the win. they only cared about kills."
yeah im not bothering with this cold war shit anymore. refunding this and picking it up used for the campaign/zombies. 
@loafyxo out right now sorry :(
metal gear solid 2 was way fucking ahead of its time lol  
@M3M3_GuY its all for a video this month. 1 big video each month on a topic that fancies me is something im into. last month was mgs4.
im trying to write a program in TempleOS what am i doing with my life.
"gonna be real, family is the most important thing to me, if i look tired its because my grind is dedicated to them. im really thankful for having my parents and brother in my life, my best friends and all.

Id give a limb for these people &lt;3

anyways tired gonna sleep a bit."
@realranton this image is fucking chad energy lol
day off today my aunt invited me over for dinner :)
man we're splitting hairs this next gen, seriously tho i doubt most gamers will see the ui for more than a few seconds to even care once the game loads. 
"call of duty cold war pc beta is great everyone. the feeling of being in the centre of a 10 man gangbang with loads dripping of your face is captured perfectly well.

its a beta lads chill out on the sweat, this aint a gatorade commercial."
im allergic to higher framerates and resolutions. i agree bud. 
Give Unity all the shit in the world but its a solid ac game and still looks gorgeous. 
no content on YouTube will surpass arab ghost hunting.
i just found out people took Blaire White seriously. i always thought she was a dumbass tbh.
hey hey sexy twitter isnt broken anymore &lt;3
@twomad im down if you let me spread my conspiracy theories.
@ModernVintageG its an odd engine. ive seen it mature with my own eyes since the days of Yakuza 6 but you could tell it was GPU bound on any system you threw it at with its fluctuating resolution counts on current gen systems. that and the framerate is always hovering around 25-29 territory.
im fucking dead lol 
"even if sony isnt directly recording and people are sending them clips which is the case please dont say its illegal.

i dont like it but its a private platform and you sign up to this on almost any social network you go on.

that said ill be looking into it more today."
"So im getting confirmations this VC PS4 recording nonsense is real.

i dont trust Sony to hold voice data securely when they were caught back in 2011 storing passwords in plaintext.

love playstation (and this isnt only a ps prob) but this weird dystopian trend needs to die down."
can someone confirm if this is real? im not getting this message but if it is that's kinda gross. 
"the amount of people im reading in the comments who thought I leaked my actual IP address hurts.

Calm down its a local IP address, the only one hacking it is my sleep paralysis demon."
@AngryJoeShow I tend to ignore the politics and watch the YouTube video. I think more people should just understand that you as a resident of the US have been given the right to speak about the future of your country. I hope the best case for the United States and for you.
victory royale 
fuck it boys we getting this coffee. 
debating the 3am coffee.
"On a real note, I hope my American friends down South have an awesome election and a great four years ahead of them. I love you all &lt;3.

Plus i can't wait for the political twitter firestorm to also die down a bit."
Did I really watch some 70-ish year old call another 70-ish year old? What the fuck lol? 
@NexpoYT last time i gave a tip i spent the month locked up so probably no.
the Iphone 12 looks solid but man are they playing it super safe.
i really miss having someone to share the laughs with. things were a lot better and simpler years back, now a days its just like you're running a tunnel that has no fucking end.
@StealthFatality im gonna remote view me a spinning dong.
im gonna rent a container and have it run meatspin for a decade and beat this world record. 
@TheActMan_YT fuck we all had that cousin.

"seriously no actual investor would tell you the methods of making multiple millions on tiktok. you keep that shit to yourself and make the bag bigger.

i needed a good laugh today. 
anyways tho start of a new day lets get shit done buckos!!!
sex with you definitely would be. 
nah dude fuck twitter, follow anyone you want and be proud of it. fuck living life by the algorithm. 
i woke up :)
@Ewok :)
"Pokemon cards looking like a fun little investment.

I'd do it but I don't know shit about TCG stuff."

Perk up lads we got a minecraft beheading to watch today.
Level 85 Raid Boss Crackhead. 
im out, i told him i was the proud representative of GFuel and my code was "SOG".
@JustinWhang good catch. ill do the shadow insult before i leave.
"im at a bar with someone who keeps rubbing their 20k instagram ""influencer"" badge. Im told how much of a big deal you can be on social media and im trying really hard not to cringe.

how hard is it not to look at follower counts and just see the community you made. jfc."
luv u
Toronto is shut down again :(
next month is coming and the war between which plastic gamer box will decide the future as we know it.
my friends @MoistCr1TiKaL and @HuggbeesTV locked me in a house and let ghosts have their way with my virgin butthole.
RT @HuggbeesTV : Now live streaming Fall Guys season 2 with @MoistCr1TiKaL , @OrdinaryGamers , and maybe more celebrity guests as the night goes on - 
@annandvirk tempting? lemme finish some work first

"@annandvirk sounds like you lived life, got new experiences and had a change in your perception of the world.

@thmkaizen yeah i emulate wii games sometimes and i have a sensor bar that hooks up to my pc

singleplayer games is where its at tbh.
"i agree, final fantasy 7 has radicalized me as a right winger.

something about that sector 7 hooch gets me riled up.

@gamer_itchy ill talk a bit about Terry but I wanna deep dive the OS more heavily for sure.
@Creeps_McPasta hey 😉

@Loeybug love you too
"im putting my soul up for sale to play cyberpunk 2077 early.

free delivery and all sales final.

ill take a photo of my hand too."
@Corpse_Husband okay but which hand?
minecraft school

@birunnn this is really good dude.

RT @gamerfrommars : The Guardian writes an article about how the energy needed to play video games is causing climate change, yet never bring up how much power is wasted on servers hosting their useless rage bait articles 
this is the seventh day in a row i had to see trisha paytas and her asshole on this app. i cant block or mute this away, my eyes are physically assaulted with the sight of her stained starfish.
@LeonLush i see your soul being removed and chopped up in front of my eyes right now.
If i see one more person on twitter telling my canadian ass who to vote for its endgame.
@RealLuigikid @secretlabchairs you got a great setup
"YAAAAAAAAAAA BOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII.

for reals tho i followed this game when they first posted a press release talking about it, can't believe its almost here. "
you could literally ask a woman how the weather is and every incel on Twitter will chant the word "simp" like they're about to sacrifice a human to the cuck god.
@Loeybug hi
i keep playing minecraft, these blocks are doin something to me i swear.
@Boogie2988 @Wizards is this like a crossover event, how does he fit into magic lore?
i will never feel safe in an autopilot car. call me old fashioned but ill switch lanes on the highway myself.

im more talking about celebs"
"its kinda shitty to see influencers get hands on tech products that are scalped away from the consumer base that allows the product to be made in the first place.

this is one of the tools Google lends out using the YouTube platform to combat illefal materials as I discussed in my Traffickinghub video.

this is a rogue moderation bot, i like to call out shit but I have to give Google credit here."
@BoiSurielle its just never going to be that easy, most of the ML bots used can go so far. the best case scenario is to isolate content like this and push for expedited peer review, covid is fucking that however.
"adding one final thing, anyone using this trend #AnswerUsPedoTube should understand that YouTube is NOT defending predators willingly. that's ignorant.

this is youtubes moderation bots going above and beyond. all i ask is human teams understand and hopefully rectify this issue."
while I understand with COVID most of the YouTube team is bots atm. for creators we're led to believe through the creator dashboard that these are manually reviewed by a human. idk about Max and his specific case for review but bots shouldn't be used to review v. sensitive videos

on a note, i'd love to make a video on this whole thing about machine learning and how it calculates a ton of this stuff. it's interesting if a little dry.

China shouldn't complain or bitch their apps are getting a ban. They have been constantly stifling external tech companies from ever profiting in their territory.
@Boogie2988 and as far as bans are considered, China is one country i dont sympathize with as they do not favourably act towards outside tech firms entering their land.

If you ever needed conclusive proof that Jake Paul is a dipshit this is it. 
@Onnethox I thought so too, but the dude straight highlighted the comment with no donation.

Racist people are big stupid.
"If anyone wants the details to the discord burner account i had hacked.

Here's the details straight from the person who hacked me. "
Felt kinda cute might delete later. 
America's wildin.
Dude i just woke up and they got child soldiers now what the actual fuck. 
Someone needs to reset the simulation.
This flu shit fucking sucks.
Good, this piece of shit needs a fucking ass-beating behind bars. 
This fucking dumbass. 
Saw a photo of a dude stealing legos during the looting, fucking priorities.
Dude im feeling sick
PS5
@SxMango Im joining you big boy
Anyways fuck serious political shit for a while, I got a minecraft video coming out.
"Been seeing tons of people throw cops as a whole under the bus, as someone who has family members who work in law enforcement.

Bad cops exist but it's the lack of education that makes these cops ""bad"".

They have no clue how to professionally conduct themselves and it shows."
RT @SxMango : so i was looking back on some memorable times with my friends, and one that sticks out is the time me and @OrdinaryGamers had to hacker man the windows 10 installation to my computer
Rioting, looting and harming lives is totally what someone would want regarding justice for themselves.

@twomad I'm gonna call you.
Dude we talked to a Hansen Interviewer that claimed evidence wasn't that important in a stream for accusations. 
Yo these K-pop nerds won't stop spamming my DMs.
@Leafy @zaptiee @KEEMSTAR @tommycsftp whoa buddy wanna calm down there, I'm gonna have to call the "Harassment and Bullying" police on you.
@atozy dude how can you say something so controversial yet so brave?
I love coming across people that act like they've never said a dark joke or something messed up within a close group of friends.
"RT @gamerfrommars : I find it funny that creators can't go after another Youtuber's appearance by the current guidelines, but they can actively encourage people to go after their sponsors.

I'd say going after another person's livelihood is much more damaging than calling them ugly."
@Nicholas_DeOrio I found it fair criticism. I fucked up and it's what happened.
@KavosYT @Nicholas_DeOrio Make it one of those mugs that show the logo when it heats up. I'd cop that hard.
What a fucking window licker. 
"The amount of work I'm putting into the MGS4 video is up their with stuff like the Club Penguin investigation.

This passion project involves a game that means the world to me and I wanna do it justice. God I love this franchise."
And yes I do wanna shoutout @Gokanaru. Hes a good content creator and I hope he'll grow to be a big one on the platform soon.
No matter what side your on. You shouldn't be okay with YouTube removing criticism videos on their vague guidelines.
@TheArchfiend The fact that you can find some snuff/sex footage on the platform still and have this be taken down as a priority says something.
@RealYungCripp Im indian and im not even this disabled.
@ClickedTazer Lets level up together my chad friend.
@JustinWhang @Gokanaru Whoa we're gonna have to take that one up with the harassment and bullying division there.

@SociableBarely And i will see you in the mental ward soon.
@ChrisRGun Only logical answer really. 
And to remind the audience. You scrolled past the tweet where I defended your sponsor harrasement but I can see how that doesn't fit the narrative.
Haven't seen a reach this good since Halo.

"You people need to chill. This is exactly what I said would happen. @h3h3productions didn't say these phrases maliciously but if you decontextualize the situation you can make anyone look bad.

These sponsors don't need the harrasement on either side. "

Youtube 2020. 
@ChrisWi54652096 @anichanzuu @Wasted_Arrow You did see how I mentioned the toby turner point? If I had a horse against one or the other I wouldn't mention a thing.
"A week back me and @KavosYT worked on a story about a really derelict server and helped save some kids from having their lives doxxed.

I feel if bigger channels started using their platforms for the right reasons, thats how you achieve positivity on the platform."
Honestly no one really wins in this drama. Im expecting big fallout for everyone on YouTube.
RT @JustinWhang : @KavosYT YouTube in a nutshell 
@twomad No man i dont like playing my life on hard difficulty.
"The amount of growth around the channel has been insane recently. I want you all to know im thankful of that.

I'm blessed to have imo the best community on this platform. I've changed content a lot through the years but I hope i can continue to remain the same goof that I am. &lt;3"

"Most of these modern day equality folk don't realize that we end up living in a scenario where people are more divided than ever.

I don't deny the world has problems but it's to a point where it seems day by day it's about putting people against each instead of the opposite."
How was "most gamers are white supremacists" misinterpreted? What context do you add to make that statement better? 
I got a video tomorrow watching out for all my Mac homies out there &lt;3
RT @MoistCr1TiKaL : GFuel likely never watched your video, employees were doxed and flooded with demands to drop him. Keem has done fucked up shit but nothing you presented was new. What was new was implying people should attack his sponsor, which is a bad precedent since anyone can do that now 
@ColossalisCrazy This is terrible for people who aren't even involved in the drama to begin with, imagine channels getting their sponsors removed because people pull out of YouTube en masse.
"Going after a creators sponsors is a terrible thing.

It's an incredibly low blow and it tends to snowball into apocalypse that blowback onto you. Plus it's pretty petty to do."

YouTube's getting spicy this year. 
Take the red pill.
"I hate what Ubisoft is doing to Rainbow Six Siege over the years.

The games going from a title that had proper hard counters and needed team comps. A meta that shifted per season to a game that resembles a 5v5 search and destroy match from CoD. With lame new gadgets and nerfs."
"Real talk, if you buy subs to get higher on the YouTube leaderboards.

These people could never survive a Halo 3 lobby back in the day. 
@M101News Same
Sound logic and reasoning. 
@DonHaci What kind of crack is this person smoking and where do I find some.
"I like Twitch as a platform they do a lot of things right. I only ever had a gripe that the moderation wasn't treated fairly for each user.

If they can crack that then I can see them being a truly unrivaled platform."
Seriously whats with the new Twitch safety staff? Seems like an interesting concept in site moderation.
What the fuck. 
Im not throwing any software under the bus btw. Tubebuddy, VidIQ or socialblade or any software may have a vulnerability. I urge them to look into it if thats the case. Once again this is my best guess.
"Why I think this is because so far posts are being made by compromised channels but no deleting of user videos which would be easy to do in theory if someone was worming in Googles Databases so to speak.

Careful who you give third-party access to on your accounts."
"I have a video on this Logan channel coming out tommorow. To give the advice here quickly though.

You might want to disable any extension software on your YouTube channels like Tubebuddy.

Seems like an Oauth Token leak somewhere."
"This is personal. You club penguin fucks think i got paid off for making that video.

How about own up to your shit and take some fucking responsibility. You're acting younger than the people your owner alleged to diddle.

RT @KavosYT : UPDATE: Club Penguin Online becomes Club Penguin Offline as the site is officially down.

I loved the video i made yesterday. But im cooling it with content like that for a long time. Its not good for mental health and for the next few months i just wanna look at some shit online and have some fun.

For the good people that we're blocked.

@M101News The mans on full defcon damage control for this game and its kinda funny.
"Last of Us 2 is really sad to see. Its like Naughty Dog forgot what made the first game was the relationships built upon the way.

This new game seems to ignore all of that and push for an agenda that's so unneeded in a zombie game.

Just sad the direction it's taken."
@KavosYT Man some people i know on twitch and i watch fucking cry and are so genuinely thankful at like 10 subs. But then you got this female DSP literally not even thankful over 100 people liked her content enough to contribute monthly. This is just saddening to watch.

@BregerDaniel Im thinking its more and more of that because of these password sets. Would be a killer op to cover tho lol
Im looking more into this myself right now. But initial notes is that i do believe this may be a troll since most IT teams won't let you use "123456" as a password.

@ClickedTazer I haven't gotten one of these yet. I think it might have been the mexican text to speech that beats the bots.
@Loeybug The ride never ends
The thing that makes me so happy is that I live during the same time as this masterpiece. 
@NightDocsYT is my granddad
"This girl who was running a harrassing botnet on some of us is now pending an FBI investigation for targeted harrasment and distribution of child pornography...

You can't fucking make this shit up. "
"I know i stopped doing creepypastas cause they all sucked.

My friends are in quarantine like me too so I'm sure i can force them to do a trollpasta video like back then."
For long time fans here im bringing back deep web stuff weekly.
Ads like this are so sad. I've never found the local single russian women in my area. 
Why do YouTube Ads straight up come with softcore porn nowadays.
@gamerfrommars I'm pretty sure thats the case here too. These stimulus checks cant cover rent and food for the people displaced.
@KEEMSTAR Researchers at Harvard at first. This is unless a vaccine forms up so being hopeful that's the case.
We seriously have a potential quarantine till 2022? Fuck.
@JustinWhang 
"It ain't cool to cheat on someone period. Take some time off and come back a better person.

You do that and it's wonders for your mental health.

But yeah, don't cheat in the first place. It can break the person you did it too. "
"@JustinWhang Nah just go to your add/remove programs and delete Riot Vanguard.

Riot has pretty solid instructions on how to clean this up."
"I hate the people who say I have nothing to hide regarding comp security.

Im not saying ppl are hiding govt trade secrets.

If you do banking, medical and school/work stuff on your pc you have shit to hide then.

Stop being a boomer and not treating your data safely."
Lots more accounts like this. Report what you can but social media networks need to stay on top of this the best they can.
It shouldn't take info like this from getting reposted by larger channels. I've been told countless reports have been filed already.
"Someone dmed this acc to me

@TwitterSupport this dude is actually selling child porn on your website openly. Way too many reports and this is still up. "
$100000 is $100000. It's good this cash will help out some people who aren't going to be able to make ends meet. 
"Just wanted to drop in on this. I've been targeted somewhat by the woman mentioned in this thread. She's actually on a new tier level of psycho.

Like SSSS-rank psycho shit. Beware. "
@JohnWolfeYT Hey man take your time, everyone understands. Sorry for you loss.
Allah has left the server boyos 
Imagine clickbaiting that your son was dead... 
@JustinWhang Probably make it super inter connected and more puzzle heavy. Honestly its like remaking re5. How?
@chillumat1 I actually kinda am not gonna lie. The guns all feel weird to me with damage and spread. I stick to siege or warzone.
#ThankYouEpicGames for making the biggest online daycare.

"I'll take RAID shadow legends sponsor money in these times and donate it 100% for COVID19 relief.

@RaidRPG lets do this."
@HWulf420 In Canada at least going to be this way until a vaccine comes. Which maybe up to over a year.
"With a near 6 month minimum lockdown.

I don't think most people realize that coming out of this the economy is going to be in the shitters for decades to come.

Kinda scared but at least its better than being an anti-vaxxer."

"H3H3 ive generally liked but shaming Bezos for donating a $100 Million for COVID-19 is shitty.

Thats a hundred million sent to saving lives/better future.

"Ximertracks is guilty and complicit in the spambot network.

Feel bad for all these simps out here.
@lugia2011_john You should report this to the authorities. Probably nothing but just stay safe and on top of it.
"These pieces of trash feeding the panic and profiting of this. This is a pack of 50 masks upcharged to $100. In reality I can get this for like 20-30 bucks.

@NexpoYT I'll get u a juicy center piece
Not often YouTube does the right thing so i got this to help celebrate it. 
YouTube did the right fucking thing. Kinda shocked ngl. 
:D
"On the verge of losing someone soon.

Take life seriously. Been up tonight just thinking. I'm getting old and it's been hitting harder than usual. Love you all."

Somehow we hit trending.

If you aren't going to do anything about 3AM nonsense do something about DMCA abuse. "

@zampa_paws I do but its inspired me to talk about these for a virus investigation. Its important people realize what apps to hand social media tokens to and clear them regularily when not using apps any longer.
Y'all wildin 
I do wish Boogie well. But this is a very straight forward lie. These standards and systems are in place to prevent things like this for a reason.
"Oath Tokens and these types of APIs do not allow for your twitter profile to be changed or security features modified.

This didn't hack your account. Rogue apps could in theory but they can only do so much. Twitter and most services will help immediately. 

Very deceptive. "

I'm clenching my fucking fist and ripped some blood out realizing that some fuckface actually lied about dying like this. I'm so fucking mad."
"Jaystation is lying about his dead girlfriend. I've spent the entire night browsing and checking with police dept in Toronto and Ottawa.

No police reports, no local news agencies and worst of all no family is confirming.

I'm done with YouTube. I'm dumb for feeling sorry..."
"@ClickedTazer Im gonna give it a day or two. I haven't seen a police report in the city about it.

I don't want to believe its a lie. Thats way too heavy man. I don't want to think he'd be going that low. I also consider the legalities of it was a faked death."

main reason I don't use the feature often. you know I hate having stuff lost to time on the internet lol "
@jessix_tv Whoever does it first will get the record for highest concurrent twitch viewers lol
Twitch is making this category because advertisers don't want ads on hot tub content. So the category is basically the equivalent to marking yourself as limited ads on YouTube's self certification survey
"RT @Twitch : We have an update on all things Hot Tubs, ad pauses, and content preferences. Read the blog to learn more: 
"
Twitch just added a big titty category 
RT @FrizeUwU : Yeah, who would have thought that nuggets are freaking delicious. 
RT @SubToOptimus : Great to know that YouTubers can’t even call out basic scams anymore. Great platform awareness. Yet they’ll run hundreds of ads that are clear scams with no problem. Money must really hit their pockets different. 
RT @TwiterVersus : These journalists are so hungry for Pokimane stories that they put her in headlines for literally saying nothing 
"Idk how Amouranth being demonetized helps anything when other hot tub streams have been uneffected.

Most Let's Play channels are in this state right now. It's because they never adapted to the changing YouTube landscape. You can't just title videos "Super Mario 64 - Episode 14" and expect to get views like it's still 2013 
The video is long too. I clicked on it when I came out, watched for 5 minutes then put it in my watch later. If other people did that too, it would have butchered their view retention and the video would be recommended less as a result of that.
I understand the concern if your channel is underperforming but telling your audience about it is weird, especially when most people watching would kill for 160k views in 4 days
When you get a 10 of 10 video

@zaptiee sorry for ever comparing you to this guy
Pokimane unironically has more balls than Karl Jacobs
RT @REALIcePoseidon : @KarlJacobs_ you are letting your fans who do not have your best interest shame you into apologizing for something you shouldn't have to apologize for, whilst indirectly causing a witchhunt I remember you said you looked up to me, so can you at least do me the favor and be a man?
RT @REALIcePoseidon : So, karl is causing a witchhunt against me in front of millions of people because he hung out with me on a Youtube stream when he was a fan, yet im still banned on twitch lol. i cant believe he doubled down on this...karl heres some advice because you're young....
guilty by association is bullshit. Karl tried to apologize for it (he didnt need to) and these "fans" still aren't happy

here's Trisha's response to the bad clips of her resurfacing 
"to be clear, I'm only calling out Trisha from a hypocrisy and lack of self-awareness angle

I don't think she is currently problematic in the same ways she was from back in 2013, 2015"

well the new allegation happened in November. so it was before the older allegation from February came out 
this is all assuming the DMs are real of course
if he's genuinely stumbling across a bunch of minors who lie about their age on accident (the accidentally part is looking less and less likely by the day) he would just stfu, block and move on asap while feeling guilty but instead he rages at them and then does it again
"looking at the new evidence.... if the messages aren't fake (i don't think they are) I don't have an issue with people calling him a predator anymore.

The way James was talking to the kid in those DMs was unacceptable."

i don't get or agree with those people either man 
@MRragreynolds i personally disagree
to compare it to LGBT. it's the difference between watching a movie/playing a video game with a homophobic character in it and buying/wearing shoes that say "fuck all f****ts"
"I'm also not saying that all fictional depictions of devils/demons is an attack on Christianity.

games like Bayonetta are all about Demons and I'm fine with it cause it's fiction and not anti-jesus

but the shoes have bible verses and references to biblical Satan. its different"
"We should be respectful of all types of people. black, gay, trans, Asian, Christian, Muslim, jew, etc.  

There's a lot to dislike Christianity for but selling merch that promotes hatred towards them is not the way. 

you can uplift LGBT+ without attacking Christianity"
"as someone who is progressive but also Christian, I've been conflicted about the lil nas controversy but I've recently come to a conclusion.
I don't have an issue with his song/video but the shoes is going way too far. it's the equivalent of selling shoes that say ""fuck all f*gs"""

@SociableBarely all of the people I mentioned tho do drama or accossate with big drama creators
that or I actually am a bad person compared to these bigger creators and I'm not self-aware enough to know how I come off as yet. idk
this is why I dislike Poki H3 NerdCity etc. they just dismissed me has a bad person and cut off ties with me because I had a different opinion/didn't do what they wanted. worst part is if I had more subs it would be different cause I've seen them make amends with bigger creators
in life nobody is treated fairly and I just need to fully come to terms with that even though it's hard for me to understand why (this is the reason racism, homophobia, transphobia, etc exists after all)

for typical drama channels maybe but since my content is based on Twitter, if the story is shallow but the response is big, that's still a video topic for me. where as for a typical drama channel it wouldn't be big enough 
"so much drama news is happening all the time. honestly can't keep up

if i could freeze time, I'd easily have enough content for 2 videos a day.

He's NOT racist. don't be dumb"
"RT @realExate : OK THIS IS WHERE DREAM IS RIGHT (his tweets are worded horribly so lets clarify):

-MC sperg buys MC and names it DeltaNinja
-sperg changes his name to Dream in 2015
-sperg says n word with his friends in 2016
-sperg sells the account 4 years later in 2019 to the YTber Dream"

"RT @OrdinaryGamers : The more I look into these Game Grump allegations the more I'm leaning on that this is unprofessional behaviour.

Messaging someone at 18, then meeting them at 22 when 30 and having sex isn't pedophilia. I hate people who throw that term around so willingly."
@TheQuartering here's the source 
"RT @Bowblax : oh, they met in Sep 2013 (non-sexual introduction) and she turned 18 a month later in October 2013.

They ended up fucking in December 2017 when she was 22

the way the info was presented I thought it was met at 14 and fucked 4 years later at 18 but it's actually met 18 fucked 22"

a reliable source told me this a few years ago after my trip to LA."
people are unironically calling Dan a pedo and groomer for fucking a 22 year old in his 30s
ok time to watch more game grumps
@GaugeTheRoom if Dan met this girl at 18 and then they fucked when she was 22 and it was consentual. how is that grooming? what makes it grooming?

@GaugeTheRoom so any consensual sex with an adult that they regret later is grooming?
you cant groom someone who you met when they were 18 
"power dynamic arguments 🙄

who made it law that youtubers can't have any sexual relations with someone who's watched their videos? "
"the reason it's coming out now as an accusation is because she's mad she got ghosted

but it makes sense considering Dan entered a long term relationship with someone else shortly after"
"oh, they met in Sep 2013 (non-sexual introduction) and she turned 18 a month later in October 2013.

They ended up fucking in December 2017 when she was 22

the way the info was presented I thought it was met at 14 and fucked 4 years later at 18 but it's actually met 18 fucked 22"

"I'm not trying to be a James fanboy here, it just bothers me that people act like sending nudes to someone you think is 18+ vs grooming/raping a kid is even remotely similar.

someone close to me was groomed, I know what it looks like and James is not that as far as i can tell"
there's a huge difference between someone like Lionmaker and James Charles but people act like they're the same
"@kaozbender_ sending nudes to a child knowing that they're one VS sending them while thinking they're 18+ are different

both are bad but one makes you stupid and the other makes you a pedo"
"criticize James, rip into him for his carelessness and stupidity. nobody should give him a free pass in that regard. but constantly calling him a sexual predator who preys on children is overboard with the current knowledge we have.

this is how dramagedon happened in 2019"
"idk why people are acting like the latest incident is solid enough to call him a predator off of

if James is proven to be a predator, I'll call him one but as of now all we know is that he's careless. a predator wouldn't ask for someone's age and say no if they respond under 18"
"just call him a pedo at this point

Nick when he called Swan to confront him on his lie 
not trying to victim blame here btw, idk who's right or wrong in the situation yet. so I'm asking genuine questions I have
plus if Seth is embarrassed about the situation and the video it happened in is now removed, doesn't bringing it back up put this back in the spotlight? invalidating the entire reason he wanted it removed?
I've been trying all morning and all last night to try and get to the original video and I couldn't. unlisted is essentially removed if it's not in a playlist 
@Johnny2Cellos congrats! I just found your channel yesterday and already watched like 5 videos. im hooked
if David apologized to Seth and he took down the kissing prank video already, prior to Seth coming out with his story. What does Seth want David to do? What more can David do?

"he is basically saying it doesn't matter if Seth consented because he was pressured by the power dynamic.

wtf? we're not holding adults accountable for their choices because of sub count difference? that's stupid"

@BanishedJourno @LittleJew10 same. I wasn't aware of the extent to which john was involved. He swept it under the rug and I didn't have any reason to look into the story in exhaustive at the time

@ElvisTheAlienTV I've never seen chat spam described as torment before. for me when I get spammed by BritBong posting DOX, I've just seen it as a thing for my mods to have fun banning. annoying for sure but not torment, thats why I found pig banning blm odd. youre right tho john is a slimy fuck
@nicholasdeorio What are you talking about? I saw a pretty epic dream video on your other channel recently

@plushman11 @Nintend0babe @BanishedJourno doesn't help her narrative. she WANTS me to be racist
@RayareReviewing one take too
"in private, in 2016 (pre-Floyd) with clear satirical intent.

I wasn't racist then, just edgy and I'm sure as hell not like that now. once the song was leaked. I was apologized for it and took accountability for my dumb joke being seen by others.

I'm very liberal and support BLM "
"yikes. trying to pin someone as a racist but making a clearly satirical and private (that got leaked) song from 2016 that I made?

the people you're defending by ""calling me out"" said N word publicly back then too. so by your logic they're racist but obviously they're not. stop "
"@BanishedJourno @Nintend0babe it was also made in private in 2016.

if we're playing that game, people like BionicPig who openly said N word at that point is more guilty. but nobody here is racist, so it's dumb to play that game.

I used to be edgy but I've NEVER in my live been a racist"
@BanishedJourno @Nintend0babe kinda fucked that she would just assume I shit talk black people when I never have
"??? My 2016 song was talking shit about everyone who wasn't black???

the song is literally called ""black Live Matter, Other Live Don't"" "
@BionicPIGtv after we DMed I know know why you banned BLM but at the time it made no sense to me, people who never talked about zaptie who said blm in any capacity were getting banned. it was weird and confusing
RT @iNabber69 : actually, trans women are awesome epic women
i remember the only thing I typed in BionicPig's chat "why is blm being banned" and insanely got banned. so weird
"Don't remember anybody calling you racist but yeah banning blm in chat was weird af lol

i was so confused and bewildered by that "

@nicholasdeorio the tweet wasn't meant to be nuclear lol just saying how i feel
RT @gamerfrommars : John Swan can't be guilty; he was picking up boulders with his daughter when this all went down.
"here's another thing that bothers me about the John Swan stuff that is specific to me.
John talked with me in-depth explaining how the ""12 year old"" using his discord was autistic and exploited my knowledge of autism to craft his false narrative. I hate that I was used for that"
Methylphenidate is such a blessing for my ADHD ass mind
@PunishedProject making a 13 page google doc on it tho
@PunishedProject im so mad bro
RT @PunishedProject : wtf did I wake up to 
RT @SubToOptimus : I can't believe that John Swan also stood idly by and continued the lie while CordWit was legitimately receiving death threats and was being tortured online. That's one of the most damning parts of all of this. That and the fact he tried to pin it on an autistic 12-year-old. Fuck
@nicholasdeorio @AugieRFC @ExedPanda 
I know the Google doc was released after I defended him. But what was in that doc was similar to what he told me in private when this went down. To lie about a story with that much detail over something so small didn't make sense to me. Theres no rational reason to lie about that
"People who are acting like John Swans story was impossible to believe and we would have to be extremely biased to believe him are dumb af

he made a 13 page in-depth Google doc with compelling reasoning to his story bring true, it's insane to go to those lengths just to lie"

Don't blame me for not being able to decipher your true opinion from your exaggerated statements that exist in the same tweet"
@lleah101 Unreasonable
@lleah101 You said everybody in the commentary community blindly believed him. Don't act like it's unreadable for me to assume you're talking about everybody in the community

@FakecelKiller @WillyMacShow @nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision when did i say it was petty? source?
@WillyMacShow @nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision yeah, so idk what your point is here. we didn't ignore the situation and talked about when it happened so....
@BigMoneyOnision @AugieRFC @WillyMacShow @nicholasdeorio ok well at least we can pinpoint where we disagree specifically. that's a lot further than most disagreements online get to.
@WillyMacShow @nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision it's not like I've ignored it. we all discussed it when it happened last month (or whenever it was, I forget exactly which month)
"@WillyMacShow @nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision for me with how my content is, it's worth a discussion on stream but not a full commentary from me.

which is what I did, this has been discussed many times on stream."
@AugieRFC @WillyMacShow @nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision I agree with your opinion but I also don't think John was lying or saying something he didn't believe just so he wouldn't have to apologize
@BigMoneyOnision @PyndrexLOL @WillyMacShow @nicholasdeorio i just see this as john giving bad advice. the guy isn't perfect just he's not being malicious here
"@WillyMacShow @nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision i dont remember him calling pieman a pedo.

as for suicide baiting. it makes sense how he came to that conclusion even though I heavily disagree with it. it's a point to critize him on for sure but it's not a big enough mistake to get up in arms and make a video for me personally"
@PyndrexLOL @WillyMacShow @nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision was it John who said that or someone else? you're saying "they" but I'm only talking about John here
@WillyMacShow @nicholasdeorio @BigMoneyOnision it would be a point to add against someone at most. I can't see myself making a video just because DefNoodles told Pieman to take a break from the internet

"RT @OrdinaryGamers : Yo Nintendo stop being bitches and give us twilight princess/windwaker HD on the switch.

facts 
to put common insults like retard, idiot and stupid on a similar level to f and n slur, devalues those words imo.
"you can use it an ableist ways like demeaning someone disabled by calling them retarded but the word is most often used to describe anything that's dumb. like ""this thing is retarded"".

where as words like ""f******"" and ""n*****"" are majority of the time used to demean gay/black"
it's not ableist to use the word retard

She has a voice line for being selected, and I also found 214 player animations.
No models however."
RT @CommentCopped : the creator of the Dream smiley face got paid only $70 and never received any royalties after that 
50% done 
RT @BEN_SHAPlR0 : 
I hope Wind Waker and Twilight Princess HD are also ported to switch soon alongside Skyward Sword
coomer 
RT @ZhugeEX : Here is an update on Metroid Prime 4 
@_TheEyrie i screamed FUCK YOU at the screen lol
RT @tayrantula_ : Bernie made a cameo in the Splatoon 3 announcement trailer. #NintendoDirect #Splatoon3 
"Skyward Sword was nutted on with 10/10 by everyone when it came out. and now everyone is like ""it sucks""

grifters smh"
"lol. 20th anniversary of Pikmin. still 3 games

5th Anniversary of Splatoon. also 3 games "
funny how the direct didn't actually start until 45 mins in with Skyward Sword HD
im still working on the video today but I took the morning to decompress from yesterday so it might not be out until tomorrow
bunty king was right. ricky is a pos! 
"RT @KavosYT : As far as people who I’ve interviewed goes @dream was a great guest.

He stuck around and just chatted after we were done even though we shot over an hours worth of footage. 

We disagree a lot and still have very different views but was a pleasure to deal with"
what if it's announced in the direct 👀 
@KavosYT looking forward to seeing it :)
@KavosYT what's your stance on the story after talking with dream?
might delay Twitter VS Dream and John Sawn part 2 till tomorrow. Got really burnt out yesterday making 2 videos and doing after hours.

@JohnSwanYT stop talking to nick. he's a bad influence
"RT @OrdinaryGamers : Instagram removed my account for “impersonation”, now they want a photo ID?

Zuckerburg you can eat my hairy ass the day I give you fucking government id over your shitty social networks lol"
@JohnSwanYT @AugieRFC ratio #dreamtwt
John Swan needs to stop trolling Dream and get back on Game Grumps
John Swan peaked with his Flex Tape video
i have a solution 
RT @Bowblax : 
also if you have an opinion opposite to mine, it means my opinion didn't change yours. so who cares lmao
"for people who're stupid. reading tweets from both sides word for word = no bias. segment of video with ""my opinion"" in it = bias.

make sense?"
yep there's bias in a video where I have a segment titled "My Opinion" you got me dude haha  
odyssey 2 
even though I still believe John Swan. After watching Dream's stream and seeing more context, I don't think Dream was intentionally lying. So I changed the title from "slanders" to "calls out" to reflect this 
@SubToOptimus how dare you miss this tweet! you biased hack
RT @InfernoOmni : heads up if i don’t hit a million subs on YouTube by the end of Black History Month i’m playing the racism card you’ve been warned
the one tweet you tacked on to the end of a thread 20 mins after already replying. makes sense that I would miss it. also it's consistent with John's story. He said the kid messaged 3 people on John's account and one person on the fake Dream account 
I missed that tweet. my bad on that. but it's stupid to call me biased when I literally read/show 8 minutes straight of your tweets against john swan, which I believe is all of them besides the one you just pointed out. lol 
"RT @KavosYT : In regards to Dream Vs John Swan

- John swans story has some inconsistencies that he needs to clarify ASAP

- Dream has a lot of weak arguments he’s focusing on way too much (grammar, use of sarcasm and specific words)

Overall I doubt we will ever find out the truth"
double upload?
render says 38 mins left but im hoping it will be faster than that
@JustinWhang @AugieRFC i agree but given how much stress he must be under have a dedicated stream on him with 300k viewers. I dont blame him
yup
new video in 30 mins
@KEEMSTAR I think you would have conducted the interview fairly (let him speak his peace fully with no cuts/interruptions) and told him to go on. but I respect his decision to not go on if that's what he thinks is best for him
"RT @KEEMSTAR : Dream vs John Swan

All set ready to go waiting on John Swan to join the call!"

@iNabber69 $$$$$$$$$$$$$$
LOOOOOOOOOOOOL 
@nicholasdeorio DREAM SAID YOUR NAME!!! LOOOL
RT @SubToOptimus : Dream has yet to concretely prove that the account wasn’t breached by the way. His damning evidence so far literally has been the usage of the words “yup” and “mate”, both extremely common words especially in a place like Australia.
RT @InfernoOmni : Dream is streaming to over 300,000 people on Twitch over the John Swan drama situation with the Pink Panther theme in the background. Alrighty then.

"I hope we get at least 1 big nintendo game for this half of 2021. maybe Pikmin 4??? 👀👀

@KEEMSTAR 👀
I welcome different opinions and points of view even if I don't agree. So please don't call me out for not having the same opinion as you when I present things in a way where you can form your own lol
@AugieRFC people shouldn't use other political beliefs to dictate who they're friends with imo
"making 1 joke about Dream's kitten comment to intro the video isn't ""constantly mocking dream fans""

the rest of the video is just reading tweets until you reach the segment clearly titled ""My Opinion"" "
im adding nick deorio tweets to the next twitter vs. so sorry in advance
"RT @mooxhaaa : made some epic swag autistic fanart

Dream was even in a video of his 3 month prior (Dec 2019) "
new video in 30 mins
@rickyberwick start shit talking dream and you will be lol
the amount of times i've pressed "prt sc" in the last 30 mins
RT @SubToOptimus : As someone who has personally spoken to John Swan several times/collaborated with him I genuinely don’t believe he’d do what Dream is accusing him of publicly. The fact that he’s spun this to make John look like a bad person goes against everything I’ve ever seen from John.
@Riot_Kassadin @realExate this is you
me 
@dreamwastaken @JohnSwanYT why on earth wouldn't you believe him? there's legit no motive to act like this. anyone who's spoken with John Swan can tell you it's not in his character to spam n word and weird 12 year old boy humor???
@JohnSwanYT With a dream post, when put in front of the right audience it could blow up in an instant. Best to get out ahead of it
@LittleFroakie65 Ok

"my video on H3 helping BritBong is banned from search results. even if you type in the exact title it won't show up

I've never had this happen to a video of mine before "

"lol I haven't been deleting shit. so annoying when my takes and my friends actions get conflated. 

Augie, Nick, etc. never had this take. I did.

Really enjoyed RE8. Still don’t like the FPS style but the gameplay was pretty fun. Only gripe is that in the beginning when the meat feature is introduced they tell you to give it to the Duke, but you don’t unlock the cooking feature isn’t unlocked until a bit later so I sold

@Job4_2 At the end of the day the biggest fear they have is being doxed, but if you just lay your dick on the table a strike is just a minor inconvenience. Still gay though.
@Job4_2 True enough. Most of the people I’ve tried to help aren’t even earning money because they don’t want to be monetized or are too small, which means they don’t have access to the minimal resources monetized channels get.
@Job4_2 Yeah I understand that, but I don’t have any faith in DMCA reform. IMO YouTube is comically understaffed and has the resources to hire and train employees to make reasonable judgment calls. Maybe you could get a side gig telling people to eat shit for them?
@Job4_2 I’ve helped a few people have strikes manually removed without appeal. They will occasionally use discretion, but not often.
YouTube once again letting someone who rapes animals (Kero the Wolf) freely abuse the copyright ID system to silence small channels shedding light on his crimes. Why do you enable animal rapists @SusanWojcicki?

I think the worst part of Lindsay Ellis’s video is that she pretended to drink like 12 shots of whisky and acted like it had no effect. I’ve been abusing alcohol my entire life to be able to drink an exorbitant amount without acting drunk, and I don’t appreciate the appropriation
@Grimkaizer I mean I’m sure it’s worth more than I paid for it at least. I’m not expecting a fortune or anything.
@mjarbo Nice, I thought they were really well done.
I have two large binders of Yu-Gi-Oh and Pokémon cards at my grandmas house somewhere unless she threw them out that are probably worth god knows how much. I barely every touched them.

Perhaps one day the technology will emerge to repair my brain and I too will be able to become enlightened and find larping as a pedophile humorous. For now I’ll settle with using my broken caveman brain to call a spade a spade. 
Ah yes pretending to be a pedophile, classic edgy humor and satire. If only I could be so smart and enlightened. 
To be honest the most humiliating portion of the video is where she sincerely takes a knee to Bob 
If becoming suspicious of someone who goes on for years about the virtues of pedophilia “ironically” makes me a reactionary conservative consider me Benito Mussolini

Lindsay Ellis apologized for referring to the killing of all first born Egyptian sons as a genocide because Moses and his people were Jewish. I spit out my beer at that part lmao.
@thekinocorner I guess. This is the first time I’ve watched one of her videos
Ok I’m listening a bit more. She really does think she’s explaining Twitter and online culture using a sophisticated and academic approach, but in reality she sounds like an insane person who lives on the internet and never leaves her room.
I had to drop out shortly after she said black people invented the concept of canceling because of some random song in the 80s. Bitch has the IQ of a grape. Respectfully.
Does Lindsay Ellis really expect people to think she hasn’t been affected by being crucified by her own people when she said at a con that she had to check into a psych ward when right wing boomers mildly bullied her? That’s what I got from the five minutes I watched at least.
I bet there is a ghost Tweeter out there who specializes in crafting viral tweets and sells his services to internet hos so they can shill their onlyfans underneath them.

@FreakinEmoRobot I guess you could say there is plenty of Whang to go around.
There is not a single picture of an egirl that Justin Whang hasn’t liked.
@BuildsLord Yeah, makes it hard to stay interested in him as a topic when I know the ultimate conclusion will be that he turned out to be a boomer with a messy divorce and money problems lmao. And yeah, those cops were obviously going for maximum camera time.
"So you’re telling me Digibros new content is so bad that it pissed his subs off to such a degree that YouTube’s bot flagged it as a hack. 

What estrogen and acid will do to a mf. "
@SandorPike @Job4_2 Ah. Well I think at this point it’s safe to classify RVs mixed with ecelebs as deviant.
@BuildsLord Yeah, he was pretty explicitly against it. I think kids that are within three years of each are other fine to date once they are in high school most of the time. The bigger concern is obviously literal baby rapists, as you pointed out. Hansen is just out of touch at this point.
@Job4_2 I vaguely remember you talking about that on MATI. When you say pod do you mean like a living space or is that a term for some sort of deviant behavior I’m not familiar with?
Wait what? For fucks sake I’m actually going to have to read his thread for this one. 
@BuildsLord I don’t have the clip on hand but during the height of TCAP he said in an interview that he wouldn’t even entertain that idea, and the guys at Perverted Justice had policies against it.
Digibro is so far past the deep end that science can’t even explain how he hasn’t been crushed to death by hydrostatic pressure.

You have autism 
@ZaptieTheBear Probably not but I was referring to the Pyro stuff. I didn’t mean he never did anything wrong, Tom is as retarded as any other YouTuber.
Actually I don’t think he called him a pedo but I agree with the sentiment he actually put forward. Pyro is an irredeemable sexual deviant that tried to use an underage fan like a flesh light.
John Swan’s friends when they realized there was no 12 year old autistic child 
That accusation was correct and the jokes were hilarious. 
 
There is one key difference between Turkey Tom and John Swan, and it’s the fact that Tom did literally nothing wrong.
@zaptiee Pescatore shows up to Nick’s house and Tommy C repels off the roof in his ill fitting military uniform and drunkenly chases him down the street.
I really want John Swan to come back and team back up with Pescatore to set up the most autistic internet civil war of all time.

I’ve wanted to post this for so long. He looks exactly how I imagined lmao 
Notorious animal rapist Toggle the Rat got his very own Kiwi Farms thread. God bless all of the guys and gals who spent countless hours uncovering this info and attempting to get the police to act before posting it 
 
@BuildsLord 12 gauge. Keep it simple.
Doxing isn’t that big of a deal. Nothing happens to most people, and if you have any sort of internet presence you should be on the no swat list and own a gun anyways 
Everyone on the internet uses kiwi farms, and no one in real life understands it. It’s not that big of a deal for people to gossip about you.
How are you going to get doxed? You operate under your real name, Einstein. 
The internet also gets really fucking boring and it’s nice to be able to just fuck off and not force gay topics no one cares about.
If you are a YouTuber and you don’t have at least a skilled trade you can work at any time, you are retarded. This shit can disappear at any time for no reason, and going back to live with your parents after you’re 18 as a man is unacceptable and you should be bullied. 
In case anyone is wondering the reason I can say retard and not get banned is because I work for the federal government.
I’ve enlisted the help of an autistic 12 year old hacker who is penetrating John Swan’s mainframe as we speak. Leaks to come. 
Seriously though, you’d have to be retarded to make up this kind of lie about such a benign thing, and even more retarded to believe it.

you don't have to sell your stonks when transferring from robinhood, just your crypto, unless I'm missing something and you can actually transfer crypto but I'm fairly sure you have to liquidate your poor doge. 
I'm being serious. Especially if you aren't in this for the meme and just invest like a normal person, if they go under getting your money back will be a challenge to say the least. You can barely make a trade or buy crypto as it is.
Transfer all of your shit out of Robinhood to a stable brokerage. This is financial advice.

@CommentCopped @KEEMSTAR @nicholasdeorio @AugieRFC @KEEMSTAR
@KEEMSTAR @nicholasdeorio @AugieRFC thank you
Had to delete all of my tweets because a copyright troll who has targeted @nicholasdeorio and @AugieRFC is now targeting me. They managed to DMCA takedown a tweet only containing a link to my own podcast. Nick is now suspended. This is beyond fucked.
@becky16hill @nicholasdeorio @LordVega @KEEMSTAR i got it too
"RT @nicholasdeorio : Def Noodles paired a gotcha post with edgy jokes to try further paint Keemstar as an anti-Semite. 

I understand the tolerance/willingness to defend edgy humor has dissipated due to optics but at the very least removing Keem saying he was joking 3x is why people hate this guy. "

@sdsatire you have literally no grasp on the situation do you.
@HarleyTBSYT All these DMs show is that John should be greatful for having someone as loyal as me as a friend
@HarleyTBSYT @JohnSwanYT They all person who isn't lying here seems to be nick, clout chaser and flip floper? seems about right
@HarleyTBSYT jesus christ no wonder nobody likes you.
@CordWit good guy cordwit
@TalkSchitAvenga @KavosYT It has been called nick for a while because I used to trick john into dragging me up in a vc on his server when he was live. But it didn't work. It wasn't called nick to make dream think nick was involved.
@zentimal_ @DiaryTabletop @WillyMacShow John would be in as much shit if I would've just dropped a tweet about it before he could take accountability himself lol.
@zentimal_ @DiaryTabletop @WillyMacShow Yes i did talk to John multiple times about this of course. Of course I wanted John to tell the truth because I wanted to take credit for the "sex mod" jokes and stuff lol
@zentimal_ @DiaryTabletop @WillyMacShow thats his decision lol. speak to him about it not me.
@JediNabber I watched it a while ago and it was really good. Seems just like an actual genuine guy who screams loud occasionally

@ClickedTazer I own that account not john, all the messages were from me 
@KavosYT I legit own the account and take full responsiblity for the messages. John had no control over the messages I sent. 
Worst thing to come of this is that it wasn't "Dream's sex mod" it was "LtCobra's sex mod" the entire time
@JamesMarriottYT Don't worry I'm still working on it

@dazeLUL @GayAreZee Real
@BluesDank @phantom_cash Rock
@DiaryTabletop @WillyMacShow You do realise that if John thought he could get away with it then I have no obligation to come forward to “save his reputation”. In actuality, had I come forward it would’ve made John look even worse as it wasn’t him coming out and telling the truth himself
@lachylannn @WillyMacShow 
@DiaryTabletop @WillyMacShow 
@WillyMacShow Alright lol
@phantom_cash @BluesDank
@WillyMacShow Of my funniest trolls.
@WillyMacShow Wait hold on. Willymacshow? We you sitting in me and John’s calls all this time? Did you know what was going on “behind the scenes” , why are you pretending that I never told John just to tell the truth lol. Of course I wanted him to tell the truth because it was one
@jakontrary Soon
@WillyMacShow Never told John to double down at any point lol. I just did what was in his interest at the time to help my friend. I understand if you wanted me to stick a knife in the back of my friend and ruin a friendship for the sake of some internet points but I’m not that type of person
@WillyMacShow I protected to him because he’s my friend lmao.
@WillyMacShow Use your brain and think “why would I come out and backstabbed a guy I’ve been good friends with for 2 years?”. Like do you not think I wanted to tell the truth because I had no issue with me and John trolling so I would’ve happily owned up. But since John lied to dream
"And if you more concerned over the idea that Me and John would “troll” dream, then I take full responsibility on that matter because it was my idea

thank you to the YouTubers who have me muted on Twitter but have been talking about the “sex mod” I was developing. "
@JeIIieh Woa woa
"I’m not going to back stab a good friend over something so insignificant. I’m sorry if your disappointed in me not telling everyone the truth or what, I’m just hoping you can understand morally why I never came forward.

Okay, now back to funny tweets"
Personally, and I think I told John this, i would’ve just told dream the truth because it was a nothing burger, but I think John just sort of panicked because he’s quite uptight in situation like this. And of course because of this I never came out to tell the truth because
Pretended he was good friends with dream and sent Harley dreams discord account, in which it was me on the account. This was simply just to troll Harley for shits and giggles. It was quite a while ago but I remember John telling dream it wasnt him or something.
Due to the fact John’s has just come out about the dream situation it’s probably about time I stated why I defended John despite knowing what actually happened. HarleyTBS is a pretty cringe kid and was messaging John about dream, so I thought it would be funny if John

@PyndrexLOL @aidinmp3 @WillyMacShow I don't think John ever called him a pedophile, but what he did say is that it was fucked for him to say that and I agree. Anyone in tune with the outside world could see that, I don't think he's attracted to children but a 15 yearold saying that about a 12 yearold is weird af
@PyndrexLOL @aidinmp3 @WillyMacShow you'd certainly get your head kicked in for that sorta stuff at my school
@PyndrexLOL @aidinmp3 @WillyMacShow I dont know if its because all of this americans have been home schooled and shit, but 15 and 12 to be is wrong and i have no issue with pieman being hell acountable for that. 3 year age this 3 year age cap that, its not 18 and 21, 42 and 45, 15 and 12 is quite a dif at that age
@PyndrexLOL @aidinmp3 @WillyMacShow I think a 15 yearold being attracted to a 10 yearold is incredibly predatory lol. Power dynamic there is off the scale.

@JamesMarriottYT im going mentally insane and what im really asking is for you to follow me back again not to mention your girlfriend used to follow me which is quite suprising due to how based i am. ok thankyou james. i think your girlfriend was very brave for following me on my other acc.

@Hankiepankie20 @AugieRFC doesn't take much to quote my mans tweet and send love considering they listen to everything he says.
@AugieRFC On a moral standpoint I'd want dream to open up the bird app and send love cordwit's way tbh due to the fact that his audience are telling cordwit to kill himself whilst sending the thread cordit made on his friend who committed suicide.
@HarleyTBSYT and the kid just read the message.
@HarleyTBSYT just seems like a stab in the dark or me and john might've messaged about it before
@HarleyTBSYT I message with John almost everyday, it's highly likely that I was one of the people John last messaged that day. Kid probs just pulled up any name on the direct message list and I was probs the most recent.
@AugieRFC it's legit 6am for him and he hasn't slept. But knowing John swan his manager actually did advise him not to. Don't see this as john coping out. trust me
@KavosYT lol
I'm not like trying to have some get out of jail card but the last couple of days in my personal life i've been some of the worst of my life. People I've spoken to personally will know this, can we just like wait a few weeks and then you can chat shit about me lmao
I legit have no clue why people are attacking me on twitter and stuff just because I was mentioned on dream's stream. It's legit like the stupidest shit i've seen bro
@M3LLOHIS seing loads of tweets about this i legit forgot what I did

@DocOnTheRadio They’re prob making an example out of her in all honesty
If you’re selling sex just be honest about it. If that’s not where Twitch wants to take their platform, then you already knew you were exploiting TOS for mass gains. It’s an obvious risk/reward
I’ll be honest, if I was showing the outline of my dick on YT every upload, I probably wouldn’t be too surprised if I lost ads. Being sexually suggestive is outlined in their TOS and while they should’ve issued a warning, it’s not like these creators don’t know about the rule. 
@KEEMSTAR Not working for me
@zaptiee How convenient!
That was fast 
@thatpuffmain Ty
@thekinocorner Lets fuckin go
@InfernoOmni Ok “Turkey Tom”
@zaptiee YT is like tattling to parents. They don’t do shit until you cry enough
@zaptiee I drink coffee all the time but mixing it with monsters just sounds like AIDS. Full blown, developed HIV. Ass cancer with bubbling hemorrhoids.
@zaptiee AND coffee? Pick an addiction
@ANTIWORLD666 This mf really said subscribe and hit the bell. If I don’t get a PS5 I’m suing
I’m against deplatforming, but when you’re maliciously posting people’s private info to get them harassed, that can result in real life consequences and harm. As a creator I can’t support that in any capacity and it’s an unspoken rule that we respect each other’s privacy.
I’ve been so confused how LTG has still been on the platform after openly doxxing multiple people. It’s defined in clear English that it violates TOS. Like it’s not even arguable at all 
"RT @JoonTheKing1 : After dealing with doxxing and harassment from Low Tier God for nearly two years I'm finally making a video on it.
"
@JoonTheKing1 Sounds like his MO. Same thing he did with my vid

@UltraRapidKO Yeah go be a condescending white savior somewhere else
@UltraRapidKO You’re sitting here trivializing the accomplishments of MLK for black people’s rights. So with all due respect as a black person, fuck you.
@UltraRapidKO He got very little done legally? Do you even know what the fuck “civil rights” are? Please stop
@UltraRapidKO You’re not even black
@UltraRapidKO Yeah and what he stood for is what made him a martyr. Not throwing out policy ideas for the dead and marching in their honor. He stood for long-standing peace and brotherhood. Not racial division and fires
@UltraRapidKO Yeah we got an inkling of police reform at the cost of lives and social rest. Massive W
@UltraRapidKO Name a single policy that came out of this
@UltraRapidKO If you ignore destruction of small businesses, loss of life and rising racial tensions, it’s pretty arguable to say that’s a net positive reaction to a single death.
@UltraRapidKO Yeah no shit. Burning stuff down will always objectively have an impact. So does genocide

@sjbdario Yea bro
Seeing people constantly slander EE really pisses me off. He’s one of the few respectable creators you guys have left and his heart is in the right place. If you keep eating each other, who’s dick are you gonna suck? There’s no longevity in a community that doesn’t care about you
@ricklesTV I can agree with that at least. In the case of ZeRo, he actually can’t get real jobs because of background checks so it’s really tricky to say what’s the “proper” thing to do even if he regrets his actions. People don’t seem to consider necessary things like income to survive.
@zaptiee How is getting darker gonna help me sleep?
@zaptiee I haven’t slept. Idk why but now my sleep schedule will be fucked
@ricklesTV @ChiChi3667 I think it’s fair if people don’t like him for the Skype messages, but this discord thing is because he’s been isolating himself and doesn’t have much contact with anyone these days. It’s an attempt in coordination with his therapist to maintain a healthy support group
@ricklesTV @ChiChi3667 Her twitlonger stated that all posts had been cleared by the victims with their expressed permission and she’s on record stating multiple times that she’d never put other people’s stories unless it was what they wanted. Make of that what you will
@ricklesTV @ChiChi3667 And that’s fair to be upset at, but Jisu openly attacked ZeRo for this and Baenessa was forced to make a statement through Omni. She still didn’t get the message until she personally DM’d her about removing it. She said it “was in the heat of the moment” and apologized.
@ricklesTV @ChiChi3667 You know it’s impossible for anyone but Jisu to get them right? Everyone else was anonymous. So that’s just “victim”. She also lied about Baenessa’s age and added a rumor about her without her consent, which resulted in her trauma, but I guess that’s cool since Jisu’s a victim.
@KrebsTLegend They think he’s gonna use it to groom kids or some shit. As if he wouldn’t be under a microscope. I have more to say on the topic, but Twitter limits don’t do anything justice
@JarraSSB @Floorcina @ricklesTV That’s not a defense. That’s all ZeRo did to Jisu. That’s an objective fact. Plz go read what you’re yelling about before u look even dumber
@Floorcina @JarraSSB @ricklesTV This guy is incapable of intelligent discourse. That’s why he’s a useful idiot for others to use whenever they feel like it
“Why is no one checking up on the anonymous victims with no described identity? We need to make sure they’re fine as well!”
@JarraSSB @Floorcina @ricklesTV You’re shifting the convo cuz even you know Jisu’s story was bullshit LOL! No one is justifying anything. That’s just u assuming shit cuz someone didn’t 100% agree with your weird worship of people who clearly have motives. I got a wool coat that would fit you nicely
@JarraSSB @Floorcina @ricklesTV I don’t remember Jisu being that 14yr old. That’s so crazy bro tell me more
This kinda whataboutism is so fucking stupid. It’s not just some random wellness check. He literally attempted suicide and people wanted to make sure he was alright. This is very telling how self-absorbed people are. “I know he tried to kill himself, but what about ME??” 
@JarraSSB @Floorcina @ricklesTV God she’s so brave and strong. I can’t believe ZeRo showed her porn. We should salute her bravery. Erect statues in her honor even
@Eli1Mitchell He brought the point up in the first place entirely unprovoked. His 2nd tweet is about avoiding circumstances where that may occur, not how people use it as a shield from further criticism
@JohnRamsaur People threaten to assault me publicly on here. It’s not like a secret
Anyone who is posting about death threats they knew that they’d get, is more than likely doing it for sympathy. You think acknowledging them and posting it online is gonna make it stop??? You’re just validating them if anything. As if everyone involved doesn’t get them
Every public figure that speaks about controversial topics gets death threats. Why is this even a point people bring up? Would my arguments be more valid if I just screenshotted my death threats before every tweet? It’s so common for all parties that it’s honestly negligible

@leesgotasthma You’d be surprised how little people know about topics they’re really “passionate” about. Shits wild
@leesgotasthma Yeah it’s just usually not possible with people who hate me for reasons they can’t explain. Too much effort at that point. I’m also an entertainer so it’s better to just have a bad guy vs good guy narrative if that’s what they want anyways
@AugieRFC It’s also expensive as fuck. Seems like such a waste of money if you aren’t constantly doing collabs
@leesgotasthma I’m glad you seem like a reasonable person on the topic. Extremism on both ends is always stupid, but it’s often impossible to find middle grounds on social media. Which is why it’s easier to just dunk on people or troll
@InfernoOmni Not everyone can have the love story we do Omni. If only the world was as perfect as the circumference of your dome...
@leesgotasthma I get Uncle Tom narratives, I just think it does a disservice to split communities rather than engaging in the points themselves. Excommunicating people for their beliefs just makes them more radical. That’s been proven time and time again in history
I give it 24hrs before an old guy lays in his own shit in the corner and it loses its health license 
@Bowblax No credits? Smfh
@leesgotasthma The issue is assuming everyone shares the same experiences and values based simply off their skin color. It inadvertently puts people into boxes and makes it fine to force your own experiences on to others to conform to a certain line of thought. Like only dating black women, etc
One thing I don’t get is how the word use to be exclusively a racial slur and a caricature of black people, but we managed to repurpose it so it’s not only racist when white people say it, but it can also be used between black people to degrade each other. Masterful play
This isn’t an exclusive thing to Twitter. If you aren’t black it’d definitely seem that way but it’s been around for awhile. 
@GlinkLive If people are gonna be led, might as well lead em ourselves.

@elijahJstaton Nah it’s been covered a million times and I’m too busy for that
@SlushTV_ @thekinocorner Yeah it’s just spotty to charge someone with like “serial harassment” since there’s also video evidence of Boogie provoking it and quite literally asking him to show up at his house.
@SlushTV_ @thekinocorner I guess that makes sense as far as the shot, but at the end of the day it was a threat presented by Boogie and Frank called him on it. Idk if it’d make sense legally to indict the recipient of a warning shot.
@SlushTV_ @thekinocorner Frank’s entire content is making people uncomfortable and harassing them. Criticizing him for it will get nowhere
@StellaVindicta I mean you kinda have to fall under that category to do what Frank does, but from a troll perspective he’s hilarious. Boogie taking the bait and provoking him to come to his house and literally asking him to, is entirely his fault
@thekinocorner @TheXManStan @TaborTCU @25 Frank is hilarious
@writesoundmusic He played a game of chicken and lost. That’s all it looks like to me
@thekinocorner It’s so blatantly obvious what he was going for and Boogie still shot his gun in a residential area. As if Frank was gonna assault him or his loved ones
I don’t get all the Boogie apologists when he directly fed into a guy who is literally known for fucking with people irl. Dumb as shit
He sounded pretty gangster when he asked him to come over like 5 times and said he’d unalive him. Seemed like an entirely provoked and deserved outcome

That was random but thanks lol 
@DENDE_MUSCLE No idea
@ZenkaiM2 It’s not that I hate the show, I just know what story telling pulls me in and what’s just kinda there. This show was pretty lackluster but it makes me curious about the comics for sure
@ZenkaiM2 
@ZenkaiM2 Only seen the show. I’d imagine the comics do it more justice
Also Jay from Big Mouth is a VA for the coin throwing dude and I can’t get that out of my head everytime he shows up
@Xenoblade_Natsu They stretched out the motivation of a main antagonist so much so that it did more of a disservice to the show because instead of just doing a basic aside with Omni man and feeding you tid bits, they leave you in the dark. It’s confusing. Also not a fan of the relationships
I constantly watch shows that I personally think have shitty story telling just to waste time and Invincible is one of em. However, I do like the memes that came outta nowhere

When you read and watch as frequently as I do, it’s pretty easy to end up on the right side. I’d be feeling pretty fuckin stupid rn if I were some of these people “against” me. Like, they’ve seen all of what I just looked at and drew an opposite conclusion. It’s free real estate
I’ve gone through 7hrs of livestreams and gotten some really good evidence. Now that I’ve finished that, it’s just the reading rainbow from here until Friday lmfao. I have interviews and questions that still need to be answered, but this is pretty open and shut in my opinion.
@Neoncaffeine No way
@InternetUnwind LOL
@calypso_live @pickachu528 You’re prob fine dude I’m just fucking with u
@calypso_live @pickachu528 Ay if anything happens that makes you question the integrity of the points you made, I recommend just going back and providing the new, improved info, or just unlisting. No shame in that. For now just wait tho
@calypso_live @pickachu528 That’s not at all how defamation cases work. I wouldn’t listen to that guy
@Charizard_Main It’s not trust it’s admitting you’re ignorant on the topic
@sjbdario I’m guilty as well because I was being a YouTuber for 8 months and didn’t care. It’s just now when I’m making statements I’ve read everything
@AnExcelSheet @Zubarashi12 Yeah she coulda done that better if she wanted a similar effect. No one is vouching for her
@Zubarashi12 Zack also has a history of lying and Nairo was the face of smash at the time
Your opinions are so malleable it’s honestly an enigma to me.
@fl0rice Suing a community is pretty costly so I doubt it
All I’m gonna say is, you guys went from sharing around screenshots of Zack laying on Nairo’s lap and jokingly flirting on Twitter, to making a hashtag for him and giving him thousands of dollars. If that doesn’t make you consider how shitty Twitter is, idk what will.
@IceeSwirl People don’t realize how much I put into my opinions and research. Like this is full time work type beat
@elijahJstaton LOL
@ArsNL02 Compared to ESAM talking, I’ll take anything
@6ahst Thank you good sir
@6ahst What the fuck
I've been listening to ESAM for the past hour. Post memes so I can save some brain cells 
I apologize for associating with myself. I didn’t know any better 
@thecheatdotcom “Based chads”. Alright pal lol
@thecheatdotcom I think I know a little about how discourse manipulates TO’s I’m good. Hope you pass 1K subs this year
@thecheatdotcom No one is upset at you for being cautious. You’re just insulting my intelligence for wanting to listen to the other side... Stop assuming this is all about returning to a fighting game instead of people’s livelihoods.
@thecheatdotcom That’s not what I said. I’m saying it’s something that happened and is very recent. I think you’re more concerned about people coming back to a gaming community rather than introducing nuance and explaining their situations. U can’t understand why things happen if u don’t listen
@thecheatdotcom What would you do if the truth ended up being uncovered? Did you expect Nairo to come back and make thousands of dollars and have a tag trending in support? I think you underestimate the importance of nuance and listening before judging on your own, but that’s your choice.
@PlantRulx @DI_Exists Are you blind? That’s the entire purpose of the document
@thecheatdotcom You pretending like you already know everything from the person who has never spoken on it, is a thousand times more concerning.
But yeah maybe LOL
@dennism28813054 It’d be golden

@SKyNeo426 He apologized in the replies of the vid
I’m going through old stuff and there’s a lot of people who still haven’t apologized for spreading shit about ANTi. Not saying it was wrong to draw those conclusions, but I’ll be damned if these fuckers can’t swallow their pride lol
@InfernoOmni @O_Knee_San Lmao
@Captain_Crete @Check8813 She posted a legal cease &amp; desist while at the same time stating her info on the subject will remain private for court. That’s textbook taking legal action if I’ve ever seen it so I’d say you’re probably wrong
@BrenFrancisco This actually makes 0 sense. No wonder it’s so easy to fuck with your community
@Check8813 Unless the clips are of Cinnpie fucking him on camera, I’m not gonna jump to conclusions when she’s building a case. I’m just gonna not make an opinion
"I see a lot of haters instantly saying, “LOOK AT TECHNICALS HOPPING TO DEFEND ANOTHER ABUSER LOL XD” 

First off, point out a single case I’ve done that and been wrong on my conclusion. 

Secondly, I’m literally just waiting to see what she says. Calm tf down Jesus lol"
@CherriLoli Cuz it’s legal jargon. If it was a twitlonger I’m sure all those bases woulda been covered. She’s already gone so if nothing comes out of it you can just go about your day like normal
@CherriLoli I mean now we’ve gone from, “she’s never addressed it” to “it’s a tiny portion”. All I’m saying is wait to see what happens in court since she’s keeping information private anyways.
@blazeblaze27 @SargentLettuce She clearly can’t talk about everything cuz she’s planning to take legal action. Did we just forget how Nairo did the same thing a few months ago? 
@CherriLoli She addressed it in the very first line
@Charizard_Main I’m not concerned about what line of thought is safe. I just want to know why she’d post this and what she knows
@CherriLoli This document also alludes to more potential abusers tho. I wouldn’t be too quick to write off her account based solely off any of that
@bbone420 Not even sure I want to. More like forced to at this point
@bbone420 You’ve been on Twitter for too long
@Federalhood @SargentLettuce Ya. Scroll up dumbass
I take new information in strides. If she actually has stuff working behind the scenes, I’m just gonna wait to see it. With how other things have played out, nothing surprises me at this point.
@MartelJoker @XZerenx @LiamLDZ @Cinnpie @WaDiRob This is just common sense tho
@SargentLettuce You don’t put “I’m sorry” in a defamation cease &amp; desist. It’s not a twitlonger
Definitely didn’t expect a legal document this late stage, but let’s see what happens. 
RT @Cinnpie : 
I bet if I offered Risu $1,000 I could get her to say anything. Prob not even that much maybe like $500 and she’d turn into a Fiverr request on the spot. I gotta test this hypothesis
And I never “thought” I’d get my money back. That’s why I did it in the first place. I know you’re a morally bankrupt parasite with almost no money to your name. In the face of that adversity, however, is when you can prove your integrity. You just happened to fail
She called me ableist for calling her out before for taking the handout from someone she thinks is a bigot. Idk if she actually knows anything about politics, but taking money from lobbyists and big corporations or the KKK, would generally make you more corrupt.
@YlMaka Right lol
I make that back in 30min streaming. It’s just funny that I can buy your morals for $100

Common sense I’d imagine 
@Bowblax Yes
The important stuff is already archived. Only reason I’m saying any of this
@grimecka Leffen couldn’t argue himself out of a paper bag
Jisu is probably the most effective user of emotional manipulation in the community and I’m gonna enjoy proving it in great detail among other things.
I'm not even joking, but I think Jisu gets a dopamine rush from being an activist like this. You can tell because right after she "took out" ZeRo before a REAL story came out, she went full anime and even put "Batman" in her bio. I'm about to go fucking nuclear so plz chill 
@DI_Exists Don’t think so
The person least affected by ZeRo is having a fucking seizure because people are worried about him and random people said, “they want him back”. Give me a break
I think it’s just because you’re just being incredibly unlikeable. “It was never about their mental wellbeing”, that’s literally the title. Stop playing these weird mental games to validate pushing someone to suicide.

@SlushTV_ Scientists are astounded at the potential infinite parallel realities in which Tariq has achieved catastrophic failure 100% of the time. This anomaly will go down as the biggest L in history for years to come.
I expect to see all of these “empathetic” smash players jerking themselves off if God forbid, ZeRo follows through on anything. Don’t wanna reference any names, but y’all really didn’t learn shit. Human life isn’t worth you making another fucking sizzling “hot take”.

@631Braden They’re just as bad if anything
We should honestly make a conscious effort to erase people’s existences when we’re done with them. It’s almost as cathartic as my favorite pastime of book burning. When will people learn?
Journalism that covers people or things I don’t like shouldn’t exist. When I see a Netflix document about criminals, I just punch my screen in anger. Don’t they know the person they’re platforming did a bad thing? Honestly disgusting and vile.

@nicholasdeorio Kudos to you. That shit sounds difficult
@brett_grisar I don’t doubt it
@nurquidation Yeah. It’s called “stop being fucking lazy and watch the full thing.”
Just finished the EE &amp; ZeRo interview. All I have to say is, keep this in mind when you’re all talking about the Sky House in a few weeks.
EE is a good dude trying to make sure people who care for ZeRo after the traumatic news, is still doing ok. No one should wish that kinda stuff on people so I can’t really blame EE for wanting to cover it. Smashers really be out for blood tho
Alright for the dumbasses in the replies. When I say disclaimer, from a journalistic standpoint it puts their unforgivable issue at the forefront and first states that this cannot be overlooked. I’m not talking about a sentence in the description. It’s called emotional appeal
@VeganDeep Ty good friend
I didn’t even get to see EE’s ZeRo interview, but knowing him he was probably doing something similar to his Ally video where he platforms their current situation and allows them to share their current mental state/affairs. It should be reuploaded with a disclaimer, not removed.

You’re not a part of Smash anymore cuz you stole my friend’s switch at Switchfest and then manufactured an email to confirm you purchased it. He only got it back because of the scratch and he remembered the serial number. Why Risu is friends with you I have 0 idea. Weirdo

@nurquidation Yeah
If you’re gonna push this stuff at least all have the same story. Amateur level defamation
Here’s Risu peddling more misinformation. In the conversations between her friends that supposedly “saw” the screenshots, they say that she said she was 17. In her OWN account however, she stated that she was 15. Please just stop. You’re embarrassing 
@Orazio91 I envy you
@LV99BoomyX She needs like a hobby or something
The people who agree with her are equally annoying and don’t actually give a shit about over half of what they’re talking about. If you gave them their own show I can guarantee it’d just be another tea channel with 0 substance just so they can talk shit while making money.
@SlayerStarX Nothing
The most disingenuous concern troll in Smash. Constantly misrepresents scenarios to dehumanize people and then cries “harassment” when people are fed up with it. As long as you’re buying her “content” tho she would even take money from the KKK. Go have a family or something Jesus

@zaptiee @JustinWhang @TheQuartering Not possible
@Raykushi It’s easy to stay silent right after going on a crusade against others because speaking out would mean reeducating yourself for the good of someone else. Not just making a single reactionary statement and dipping
The goal is that I can peace out with all the new subs and someone else takes my place. I’m tired of talking about these dumbasses
@Raykushi Easy to say that after contributing to multiple people’s downfalls
If I was playing nice, none of them would care. Your community responds to toxicity and lobbing accusations. So I play your game in reverse. That’s just how it works
I’m wondering if me being a dick is starting to wake up people in Smash. It’s true that literally ANYONE can do what I’m doing, the sad part is none of them care enough to try. You may think I’m morally bankrupt for profiting, but that’s the same reason they stay silent. Crazy

@Ggsimp4 @TheOmniLiberal Pretty sure you’re quoting a tweet I made from 2019. Some “research” heavy guy you are huh
@Ggsimp4 @TheOmniLiberal My problem is not only that you assume what my current political beliefs are, but the fact that you could easily disprove yourself JUST by going through that thread and reading how Contra is now directly backpedaling on her own views. That’s the entire tweet
@ASAP_ANKUSH No one is “struggling” with that concept. It’s just people are smart enough to see that a few tech corporations control almost all of the public discourse. I’m not simping for a company’s right to blacklist anyone they feel like
@Ggsimp4 @TheOmniLiberal Says the guy quoting his own debate knowledge while jerking himself off.

@razeyhetro It’s really not that serious

@AlexB_SSBM You’re missing a critical detail. We’re in America
"@AlexB_SSBM ? 

Your question is entirely irrelevant dude. Just because you think underaged drinking is cool, doesn’t mean the bars you attend are gonna start pouring drinks for them and hotels will not intervene. What kind of dumb fuck argument is this when it comes to professionalism?"
@AlexB_SSBM That’s hardly relevant when you’re in jail
Arguing in favor of breaking the law by letting people under 21 drink at your events isn’t the own you think it is, and it’s majorly why people think Smashers are degenerate child predators. Good luck getting Nintendo back with all these posts you guys are making.
@Scarfy325 @jjonnaultt @kongmunism @fork_rich Found the guy who forgot about both times Zack and his accomplices “vouched” before the truth came out. You can’t tell me you’re an adult and this gullible

Weird to diminish an actual case of sexual abuse to just, “not narcing on your underaged friends”. Maybe if you’re trying to run a gang, but my assumption was that the community was for a party game.

@MasKpls And? This is a straw man. I’ve been very consistent on my views unless you can actually point something out which you haven’t. Which is normal. I already think a majority of your community is just sheep anyways for this exact reason
@MasKpls Yeah I agree. You act like I wouldn’t support having them all out
@MasKpls Ya, that would involve not having adults around that are so spineless they’d let their friends get black out drunk because they don’t wanna be a party pooper. If she didn’t wanna see this story she wouldn’t pin it to her profile and look at it every single day
@MasKpls I don’t claim to care about anything but the truth. Giving the power of society over to those that have been wronged wouldn’t create the utopia you think it is. The law doesn’t suddenly not matter because of someone’s retelling of their story
Also the fact that he frame 1 RT’d it lol 
These kind of responses that fully absolve him of any role is why I stated that it appears the relationship they had together contributed greatly to the bias involved in crafting this narrative.
You state in your twitlonger that he “accompanied” you to the party. He not only has a legal obligation to intervene, but to absolve him of ANY responsibility is an incredibly weird perspective. Especially if we’re talking about steps to make sure this never happens again.

@CassKittie @Mawlerz Thank god
@CassKittie @Mawlerz You definitely should not be in charge of any events in the near future
@CassKittie I’ve never drank in my life as a matter of fact. You might be only able to focus on one subject at a time which is good for you, but for others it’s not a reach to call out things that directly result in sexual abuse and neglect. You do you
@lookingCoFiiine Until you don’t live in America, you should probably follow the laws in America. It’s a fucking gaming community. Not the senate floor
You can’t logically spark a debate on how to keep minors/underaged members of the community safe and then laugh at the prospects of providing alcohol to them in social settings. It’s a part of the Smash culture and it’s incredibly irresponsible and illegal.
That’s kinda the entire problem

@ant_ssb @fireheart4560 Ok that’s your opinion. I’d ask you to elaborate that with specific quotes and references if you truly think that.
She also didn’t say she was groomed or taken advantage of which would make sense when you consider she was lying the entire time.
"1) The Nairo comparison was that they were both lied to and widely skewed in the public view. 

2) Both ANTi and MVD did nothing to prevent the scenario that allowed underage drinking. These two are not different at all. 

3) The woman involved didn’t say she was drunk. "

@randomkandor ?
Absolute fuckin morons
With the way MVD is defending himself rn, you’d think he woulda been cool with ANTi’s case since he clearly doesn’t give a shit about the law LOL! People like this guy who have no remorse or self-reflection on underaged drinking are the reason it’s so prevalent in the first place
@AkashicGaming @0verLade @MasKpls @Minstora_Gaming I literally said verbatim, “in the case of enabling underaged drinking, I find both MVD AND ANTi guilty”. You want me to crack down on the guy that already got death threats for it over the guy that was praised as a hero? Ya nah stfu lol

This story is changing quite a bit...You NEVER said you told her not to, but now you did? That’s crazy bro...almost like the narrative shifted when it was necessary? That word “accountability” sounding less and less familiar to MVD here

@Sekki_ssb That’s from members and patrons
@Sekki_ssb Tomorrow
ITS GREEN!!!! It was yellow before manual review which it shouldn’t of been based off of the way it was formatted. Now I can sleep happy 
@elijahJstaton Bitch
@vaporwarezru Ok I’m glad I got your name right cuz on Twitter I thought it was “Vaporwave”. It’s good in the credits 👍
It's live for early viewing. Still ironing out stuff for its debut tomorrow 
@fatmanstanacco1 More like 10am PST
@JO_sPLatR I know that you fucktard
@angtaz007 Tomorrow around 10am
@TheAngryGamerR6 I should get a promo code wtf
Now that everything is rendering, it’s time to reward myself with day old Taco Bell nachos. God is good 
Members are included in the Patron scroll. Although I’m not gonna go back and retroactively add every new person that joins now, you’ll be in the next credits for a pretty solid vid. Not missin out too much
Just working on the credits and the thumbnail now. Video will be live on the Patreon and for channel members later tonight. It’s $1 to become a monthly patron and $1.99 to become a channel member. This is purely for early viewing so keep that in mind. 
@its_misfortune Yessir. It’ll be on there very soon actually. Just gotta render and all that jazz

You can hire me for PR advice btw. Depending on how difficult, I might charge a fee. This shit is time consuming 
@NuancePneuma Infinite money 
@_ChickenBear_ It purely banks on being top of search results for clicks. I tend to avoid that kind of method because it’s far more degenerate than people point out
@NuancePneuma Yessir!!! They could always just not fuck people over in the first place if they didn't want someone to profit fixing it lol
@NuancePneuma Nah I’m not that loaded lmfao. I did make some decent money after the Zack vid tho
@NuancePneuma Question mark? 🥺😳
@Atonal0_ Yeah nothing changed. I’m just saying how quick it usually is to edit
@turbotoby95 I’ll drop it later tonight when I’m actually done for Patreon/Members. Not posting it outside of golden hours
I live off cups of coffee during these editing binges. Making shit like this only takes a ton of time to write/research, not necessarily edit. For anyone curious about getting into it
I tweeted out that deadline without having much editing done and I’m already almost done by 3pm. These paychecks are too ez. Keep em comin
@Phuton9 @RiotLettuce Cool so does everyone else. Take a seat and join the party
@Phuton9 @RiotLettuce Yeah it harmed ANTi dumbass. The video was made WITH him and everyone actually harmed. You're one of the drones that'll eat up an emotional tweet and peddle whatever talking point they want you to, So I expect you to mindlessly change your opinion anyways.
@RiotLettuce @Phuton9 Just annoying seeing people assuming what my "logic" is when they don't even know the girl was 16 to begin with. Mfs didn't even read what they're spreading shit about
@RiotLettuce @Phuton9 Firstly yes, I searched to find this. Secondly, can y'all ever wait like 24hrs before jumping to conclusions about moral consistency? God fuckin damn lol. This why we're here in the first place
@CordPriv Take your time circle man
@writesoundmusic Thank god someone picked that up lol
@vaporwarezru With a burning passion
Even after knowing I hate most of you and you hate me, you’re already talking about it. I don’t even want to have to be doing this shit, so by all means, convince your “good” leaders to speak up. They’re the ones that left him out to dry in the first place.

I’m genuinely trying to think of a single female commentary channel that I respect or have been invested in. Any second now
How is it even possible you manage to talk about the same person for 20mins each day and NOT think you’re a petty drama channel?
Maybe because when a man talks about something, it doesn’t take over 10 videos in the same week.  
They keep doing my man Tipster so dirty. @TwitterSupport 
@DavidTheGenius0 Please consider donating to my Cashapp
@KrazeElk Yeah no shit I’m agreeing with her genius

This is something I’d write in a sketch. How this exists in the real world is simultaneously tragic and the funniest shit I have ever seen.

So this vid is prob going to be around 25min and I’ll be dropping it along with the full length interviews for transparency and for those of you that are curious. First time I’ve interlaced interviews into a project so it’s a big upgrade for the Detective’s case file.
@BanishedJourno One of the most open and shut cases I’ve literally ever seen
@_ChickenBear_ There’s no appeal for this vid that would work. I’m pretty sure they just caught on to the fact I said the n word

I’m not going to risk fucking over any potential validity for a case, because someone wants to pursue some pseudo-justice through an online forum. That’s not real justice

@SeanJac06731275 Nah relax lol
Guess he couldn’t respond 
Just because you jokingly hating white people is mainstream, doesn’t mean it isn’t toxic. I treat everyone the same and don’t put race on a pedestal. Meanwhile, all you do is promote racial division with your rhetoric. You just lack self-awareness
@FireKing__ That’s not what he said at all.
Yeah and there’s people that hate white people “joking” around in your communities too. You can find bad faith actors in every community possible. This isn’t a real argument 
Black people will really be upset at you for not being as emotionally unstable as them over a word. Nigga I gotta go make money and take care of my family. I don’t have time for that to control my mental
So you’re saying I should bitch about my ancestors whenever someone calls me a name? You realize by allowing that word to have power over you, you’re just chaining yourself down to history. I’m not a slave to a word. Prob the most bitch made mentality possible 
@SlayerStarX They don’t actually care about half the shit they say
Yeah...you guys totally don’t have some kinda ulterior motive to hate on white people. You know what helps get rid of racial division? More racial division. The irony is lost on you. 
My entire personality isn’t being black. If comedy is subjective, then so is the people that enjoy it. Only difference between me and you is I don’t shit my pants when I see a naughty word. Not all black people have to think the same weirdo

Don’t get me mistaken. I am 100% doing all these smash videos because they do the best and they piss most of you off. The fact that more people in your community dislike me makes 0 difference to me. The end result is gonna be the same cuz you all can’t fucking read apparently.
@Paradoxisdumb @sebgoon666 It’s called a joke fuckhead. Your entire community doesn’t matter.
A group of fuckin cry babies
If you’re trying to argue that a black dude is racist because he thinks your “Only black people smash server” is fuckin’ dumb, then good luck with that. As if I didn’t just say I hate Smash players in general like a week ago. This is part of the reason why

@Teikeji1 @EnnuiKeaton I think victim mentality has a dangerous habit of just removing any personal accountability.

@RipRoshiB LOL
@BoofedSucks Absolute leech
@brett_grisar Amen 🙏
I think the best take away from the last week is that if we ever see a top player or figurehead wanna “pitch in” on drama, you can just shut them down by linking their own tweet, and that’s fantastic. Was getting tired of “hot takes” from gamers
@EnnuiKeaton @Teikeji1 I have a sneaking suspicious most of them will shut the fuck up from now on
@Teikeji1 @EnnuiKeaton Uh...idk lemme guess. The part where he admitted to it and apologized?

@MVD731 @fowskate @D_DiscipIe You didn’t urge them not to at all while also knowing it was happening. That’s what we call “complacent”. If you witness a murder and use this same excuse you’d be an accomplice cuz it’s not a real explanation. That makes you part of the problem
@MVD731 @fowskate @D_DiscipIe Yeah whatever
@MVD731 @fowskate @D_DiscipIe That’s not at all what I did. You’re not a hero for knowing about and condoning through inaction, underaged drinking. Sorry if I disagree with you being cool with illegal shit
@MVD731 @fowskate @D_DiscipIe You just said that it didn’t make sense to mention it because the decision was pretty much closed in on, and his shit was done half a year ago...It’s very weird how you’re more focused on defending your silence than disavowing the #2 player in your own community.
@MVD731 @fowskate @D_DiscipIe Why is your take that it’s cancel culture to have verified concrete evidence of guilt? You’ve been spending too much time on Twitter MVD
@MVD731 @fowskate @D_DiscipIe So even tho you openly and actively still engage in conversations on Anti to this day, a single tweet publicly disavowing crime in the scene is asking too much because it won’t “magically” do anything? Are you seeing any lack of consistency and integrity there or nah?
"RT @fowskate : @MVD731 @D_DiscipIe If you're referring to the Samsora situation having layers I agree, but that situation was dissected in great detail and already lead to the conclusion of being a felony?

RT @fowskate : Real quick just clearing up some confusion that's been going on in Smash Twitter. Here's my take. Hopefully it helps: 
Btw this isn’t an attack on Cagt. He’s like the only reasonable person I’ve talked to. It’s about the discussion people like MVD are trying to create to distract from my existence entirely.
@palebl0od @Cagt3000 Chill out a little. He’s like the only person acknowledging it
@Cagt3000 Well I appreciate your honesty Cagt. I’ve just seen people who refused to address it and instead make a dig at me for actually helping.
@Cagt3000 I’m just saying the fact that you didn’t ban him after Salem’s response, and the process was somehow perfectly finalized 5-days after the conversation I sparked, is a little annoying to see. As if my involvement was irrelevant
@Cagt3000 You mean besides the screenshot he admitted to in the discussed twitlonger that carries 5yrs in jail? Must be some juicy shit
@Protoscan You’re assuming this is about money. It’s a matter of respect and integrity
@Cagt3000 Yeah but like, that’s really easy to say in hindsight after I put all the pieces together myself. The twitlonger he made starts off with a lie and I don’t see how it was overlooked.
@Protoscan I don’t care about what happens to their community. I care about people lying to profit off my work...
I genuinely don’t understand how all credit is being attributed to TO’s in this scenario, when Cagt himself stated BEFORE my video came out, that he pushed Sam to make this incorrect twitlonger to bring this to an END and for CLOSURE. Am I just suppose to take being discredited?

Nice of him to openly drop the “nice guy who cares about the safety of the community” act just like that. Saves me a lot of time

"I made a video about month old public information and blew up Twitter.

Those good points wouldn’t need to be made if mfs could just read instead of making baseless accusations. Actual children "

RT @DJ_Paypig : 
RT @fowskate : I was unaware this video existed up until recently. Tweeting here for exposure 
RT @SlushTV_ : the gang holds an intervention for kino 
I’m not saying Anti has never done anything questionable. I’m saying the reactions you all had purely because of the Me 2 atmosphere was 100% reactionary and slanderous. You’ll all be sucking my cock in like a month anyways when I put it into a video. Fucking sheep
@whitejohnlennon Neither is not reading and researching anti’s position before making blanket assumptions. Guess we both have to make some concessions
@whitejohnlennon Can’t win an argument with an idiot
@whitejohnlennon The girl involved literally said it wasn’t rape. Try again
@whitejohnlennon The fact that you’re asking that means you haven’t even paid attention to any of Anti’s responses. Laughable
@whitejohnlennon Again, you’re reaching really hard on these points yet won’t take Anti’s word. That’s what we call a bias. You’re not qualified to cover this
@whitejohnlennon Because unlike you I don’t skim through shit and make rushed statements. You’ll hear about it soon enough
@whitejohnlennon That’s what we call speculation. You can’t just say how someone felt about it and that’s it. Is she a mind-reader? Such a dumb point
Anti making advances on single women is not a crime worthy of this level of ridicule
Thanks for proving you just skimmed everything before making a contrarian post. Don’t worry, papa Tech is here to fill in the massive illiteracy gap. Speculation is not a conviction  
@whitejohnlennon What you call “getting other people drunk” I see as a failed advance on a grown woman. In the first twitlonger he even asks if she’s alright. Massive reach
@whitejohnlennon Yeah, first off I wouldn’t preface it with a trigger warning on “rape”. You dismiss his defense on supplying alcohol and then just put a blanket title on something entirely unsubstantiated.
There’s a reason people who don’t like me are forced to agree with my content. It’s because I do my research. While it’s easy to make posts like this with surface level comments, I can 100% GUARANTEE you haven’t read even half the shit you’re linking. Stay in your lane

This is for the lazy mfs that ask in the replies instead of doing 5secs of research 
@llumys This is all easily verifiable information with a few searches. You’re just fuckin lazy
@TeamYouTube run my man his play button 
@ThurgoodTole12 Nothing so far
Holy shit she actually deleted the false information. The level of character development here is honestly insane. Bravo 
@SsbuEden Esam said it himself. Google is free
She’s prob still salty cuz I lost her boyfriend his Nintendo representative position and he was almost homeless. I only take dubs
@HeroScrappy Ikr
Incorrect. Only random nobody locals have me banned. Realistically if I attended an event I’d have a line of people high five’ing me. Twitter isn’t an accurate reflection of reality 
@atooooomic That’s the definition of suppression. That just proves my point even more
Btw 
Nobody blew up his explanation. Nobody campaigned for his inclusion back into the scene. Some real fucked shit was said, but not a whole lot of apologies. We’ll see about that shit
@SharpyUltimate It might be fun to go back and analyze responses in a series of case files. We’ll see what happens

@Croudss Buttery Jack and home style club
 
@Knightish1 It be like that
Seeing people actively spread lies to detract from the discussion, however, rightfully pissed me off.
Regardless of my opinion on Kokiri, I actually really respect this response. My point in the video is not to revive conversation on that, it’s to point out blatant hypocrisy and inaction with an easily digestible anecdote. I don’t actually care about changing anything about it 
This chick is stupid. I’m ordering Postmates 
@zaptiee Because I’m black
These gossiping mfs are the worst clique in the community. Lacking some serious brain cells here
If I ask you to clear up countless claims with evidence, it seems fair to provide it. Instead you’d rather make sassy quote RT’s cuz of your “rule on drama”. Here’s a rule, how about don’t start spouting bullshit you heard while gossiping, if you can’t actually prove any of it.  
@BaelyLive Full of shit
@XanozIchimonji You’re spreading lies about me and then not backing that up. Your group of gossipers is of little relevance to me. No shit I’m a dick, but at least I’m not a cowardice liar
@megallade Nah she spent it on healthcare immediately
@XanozIchimonji How convenient that you can’t back up how you’re lying so coincidentally, I can’t defend myself. If they’re screenshots about ME, there shouldn’t be any confidentiality problems. This is just you bullshitting cuz you can’t back it up now that I’m asking.
@XanozIchimonji Post the screenshots
@XanozIchimonji For someone that preaches about accountability, you sure as hell seem to be missing any textual evidence to support your lies. Keep feeling like the better person tho
@yaboiplaystand I exposed her for being actually fucking terribly to EVERYONE in the community. Not just men. She turns that around to being the biggest victim because “criticism is harassment”
And they call ME the liar...
This is just blatant libel at this point. They play the telephone game with information until they find their favorite accusation 
@XanozIchimonji @Sappuration You didn’t “find out” my history. One person who I’ve exposed for starting harassment campaigns against others in the community by using her radical politics, told you I was a piece of shit and without a 2nd thought you started bad mouthing me without any research. Pretty shallow
@XanozIchimonji @Sappuration If it’s weird then get one of your morally correct leaders to do it. Oh wait, they were silent for months and let him off the hook 🤷‍♀️. Guess that didn’t rly work
She really just slipped in “harasses minorities” after calling me a liar. These people are fucking insane lol 
@XanozIchimonji You’re basically saying you get your opinions from other people which means yours doesn’t carry much weight. Enjoy making assumptions about things and people you don’t know I guess?
@XanozIchimonji Am I now required to like every woman that openly talks shit about and defames me? Wtf is this argument? Now you’re accusing me of just hating all women lol
@XanozIchimonji You’re literally telling me how I should feel right now. You shouldn’t apologize if you didn’t do anything wrong. This thought process is not only self-absorbed but deluded.
@XanozIchimonji That’s you projecting. I’m doing this purely because I feel like it. I don’t have to hide anything cuz no one actually cares
@XanozIchimonji I didn’t “fuck up in the past”. People who dislike me spun a clearly false victim narrative because I annoy them. You putting those two scenarios next to each other and saying “yet he wants Samsora blasted” (who committed a legit crime btw), is actually laughable.
@D_DiscipIe @XanozIchimonji @ReallyRisu I’m not a smasher. You take that back
@XanozIchimonji Uncomfortable*
@XanozIchimonji I also don’t think a comedy sketch is the same as potential jail time but hey, you do you
@XanozIchimonji She responded to others before the video, that people telling her they beat off to her content was fine because she knew what kind of content she made. So to turn around and say someone who is obviously joking then makes her feel comfortable when she’s clearly bias, is bs
My favorite part is how Risu started it lmfao
Why does everyone call it that. I didn’t just post a vid of me beating it to Kokiri. It’s a sketch in a video about ESAM. She’s not even the main topic or a topic at all

Hi.

Was thinking about streaming Little nightmares 2  and starting a playthrough for yt either today or tmr.

but idk about streamin today🤧"
@ThurgoodTole12 I have no idea who tf this is
@CuthbertThunder @RAMBOSS_ @pausail @BlorgusKun It’s bold of him to assume Id refer to someone with such little influence as a “top player” in the first place. Like that word just includes the top 200 or something
@BlorgusKun @RAMBOSS_ This guy’s a dumbass don’t waste your time
@RAMBOSS_ There’s no change in the substance of what I said. You’re just backpedaling
@RAMBOSS_ Not a single top player or figure head has addressed it. You’re suggesting I list every person that hasn’t so you don’t throw a hissy fit? Fuck off lol
Ignorant comments and people like this are why a YT comedian needs to handle this shit FOR you. Fuckin hell
Top players consistently and ruthlessly bludgeon others with their fan bases for crumbs compared to this. I fail to see the problem in asking for consistency and transparency from the ones that represent and run the community you’re in. 
@NotSoImportamt DM me it if you find it
@Mawlerz I pointed out people who called out me obviously like VoiD, Dabuz and Coney, but anyone with significant influence would do. It just seems weird that even Cagt talked to Samsora and didn’t seem to have a problem with him hiding everything for legal reasons? Like wtf
@Dippy12821579 @WatchTheAnkles @corder_eli @The631Braden @Samsora_ Stop wasting time arguing with Samsora drones
@KenHatHatWithK2 In this case I’m pretty sure it would be tried in Louisiana because it has to be where the actual child resides, but this is just answering a question.
@AaronYourLoser Lmao
@ImmortalJD99 That’s irrelevant to the crime Samsora committed
@ImmortalJD99 There’s already concrete evidence
"Someone was saying, “Well doesn’t Samsora live in Florida now?” In regards to the penalties for what he did and to that I say great question! 

Let’s see...oof 

Florida is lookin’ like a 3rd degree Felony. Depending on where this would be tried, his odds are pretty slim "
@GidyTheGreat Only if you’re over the age of 18 so no, but it is kinda shitty.
They’re all waiting until they can’t ignore if any longer to make a statement. Their character is built on how safe it is to act. Morally bankrupt
"Notice who is silent on the topic in the Smash community. Now tell me why it’s all the top players and leaders.

It seems like Samsora is deleting tweets with my video plugged in his replies and just like with ESAM, the official reddits strike down any links as well. This is the kind of "protect our own" mentality that kept all this shit under wraps for over 3yrs in the first place. Weirdos

The question of “why” this is a prediction and how it may correlate to the direct knowledge that Salem had, are not things to be overlooked just because you feel attacked. If you didn’t do anything wrong then you shouldn’t have to worry about it this much.
To properly view a case with limited information, the best thing you can do is step back and look at everything as it fits in the grand scope of things. The assumption that I say “pedo enabler” or that that was the purpose, is a reach from my perspective. I’m building a case.

@Yehss_ I just wanna know if he said the gamer word
@emerald_not Ok I disagree with you then cuz people who do weird stuff around kids should not be major figureheads for children. He 100% shoulda lost his involvement in the community. That’s just like society 101
@emerald_not Then state clearly what you’re against because you’re being incredibly vague for no reason
@InfernoOmni Nice seeing u thrive tho on the real Omni. Enjoy ur shit
@emerald_not Because you don’t need a court to KNOW if something was wrong. To sit there and do nothing with your dick in your hand is what a dumbass would do. “No action until the courts!” He admitted to it. That’s not a mob coming for him, that’s the consequences of his own actions.
@InfernoOmni Fuck you. I’m unlisting the vid
@emerald_not Your initial argument is about legal processes having full control, yet you don’t know the laws and also don’t agree that a community of primarily kids is justified in shunning them from the community? Just say you don’t know wtf is happening instead. It’d save a lot of time

@_ChickenBear_ I thought I made that clear after I replicated the same mentality with ESAM. Literally did all that with like 10yr old shit
@emerald_not You still there bro? Hello?
Lots of people saying, “People grow and learn from their mistakes!” Wouldn’t say that shit for like over 80% of the players they kicked out of the community. Suicide is sad, but so is having no moral backbone.
@emerald_not Like telling a 14yr to masturbate with an ice cube?
@stoutpump Yeah the people that go the extra mile to send threats and make life hell is not cool at all. Beyond the overall joking and criticism which is pretty much expected with those types of scenarios
@CoughDropSyrup If I don’t explicitly state that people will randomly say I supported it so ya know
@elijahJstaton Bitc-

@ZamboniSSB Tell that to the very very literal dictators on all these platforms who commit heinous human rights violations. This argument isn’t a consistent one
@RealFastus Their argument is it’s implied through his rhetoric on the election which is totally just confirmation bias AIDS
Sorry, but it’s kinda hard not to pitch in on this topic frequently when it’s everywhere and the implications it can have on the future for the internet are massive. I go back to funny man now

@itsSirKnight Ya I thought it was fucking dumb regardless. Onions make me cry 😢
@lul_nul @Viz55168454 Whatever u say dude
@itsSirKnight Apparently that’s a common myth on counteracting tear gas according to a singular comment I read.
@lul_nul @Viz55168454 Ya sure, if you ignore the fact that the riots were nation wide. That’s a pretty big straw man to say it was “just your local Target”. Difference is I’m not making an exception for either
@lul_nul @Viz55168454 Definitely didn’t sound like that when u were justifying differences in BLM protests where people were killed and buildings burned because one was a civil rights movement. Regardless of motive I disavow that just like the shit at the capital. You gotta be consistent dude
She sounds like Sarah Silverman 
@lul_nul @Viz55168454 Being politically divisive for years on end and being blindly ignorant to it cuz you’re on a “team” contributes the most to this shit. Destruction on both sides is bad.
Omg yes! America is saved 
@schmovin I don’t fuck with people who are annoying. I guess we just disagree
@schmovin Lead with that instead of, “this is a dog shit take” and maybe I’d believe u
@schmovin I have words muted so I didn’t see this response but it’s still fucking dumb. No one is supporting anyone. Freedom of speech is important and you can’t just pick and choose which protests are legal and moral when both cause destruction and loss of lives. It’s not black and white
The way people treat politics like sports fans is annoying. You’ll argue to the death for your team, but you’re not even a player.
@schmovin You added nothing. Not an opinion bro but thanks
@schmovin Good you had no input after all. Just checking
@PetesLaughin You’re saying that one is based on lies and that everything BLM stands for is 100% the truth of the world. If that’s what you believe then cool, but that doesn’t mean their MOTIVES are different you absolute fucking brainlet. It has 0 to do with your personal beliefs dumbass 
@PetesLaughin Nah, you made an ad hominem attack on my diction because you lack basic vocabulary and then proceeded to miss the point again. The entire point is that both arguments originate from the same place. Just say “Fuck Drumpf!” and go dude.
@PetesLaughin You coulda just googled it instead of admitting you’re illiterate. 
@PetesLaughin I don’t think you really understand what’s being said here. Irregardless if it’s a lie or not, they’re both protesting to defend something they believe to be essential for protecting certain freedoms. What part of that origin is different? You just disagree and that’s fine.
@schmovin Instead of responding like a fucking bot account and adding nothing of value, how about u put it in to words since u have the superior take.

@PetesLaughin Just from the way you describe both positions you’ve already established bias. If u support destruction and loss of lives on the basis of a civil rights movement, then it’s really not a far reach to at least TRY and understand where your opposition comes from.
@mouglexe I think  did a think piece about it
@PetesLaughin Oh gotcha. So one is different because you disagree with their motive. That just makes you bias. That’s not really me conflating anything. Everyone believes they’re the right ones dude.
@PetesLaughin Plz elaborate
@BanishedJourno I’m always ready. What could be more disciplined than that?

@drmrme08 @FridaysOVPyro And? They called George Floyd a martyr too. Do you just assume martyrs are only associated with violent movements? I don’t have time to give u an English lesson

@craunchers Pretty much
She’s fucking delusional. She even took the time to go to my unused ig too. People get one viral tweet and really think they’re somebody. Clout is a disease 
Update. I rewatched the video and the only reference to the word is at the very end where I call her an “attention whore”. I guess she just hears what she wants to hear tho lol. This is so fucking dumb I can’t rn

In fact, I’d challenge you to find a single point where I attack you personally. That’s not even close to the style of videos I make and the fact that she would blatantly lie about this is telling.
Nowhere in my video did I call you a whore...You seem to have a knack for projecting situations in which you’re the most victimized. How peculiar....

@earthyari_ The only reason this conversation exists is because someone told me u were saying something. The difference is I’m already working on something else and you’re still living in the past. Go write some more letters to yourself or something
@earthyari_ You’ve been chimping out on Twitter for a straight week because it’s the most attention you’ve ever gotten and you can’t let it go. Take your bald ass back to school so you can learn how to run a business. If the only sales you get is from race baiting, you got a bright future.

@yeehaw881 We gotta wait and see just what’s all set out on the table
@jflac0 There’s lots of other tweets about it but here’s one 
@awolblanc It happens once every 4yrs and they can’t even get a night shift. They called California the second the ballots closed and it has the highest populace of any other state. It’s ridiculous
@awolblanc Same as yesterday where it was stagnant for like 7hrs. I’m pullin hairs here
@ClarissB23 Bro I can’t fucking take waiting any longer for these counties in Nevada and AZ lol
I was up at 4am when the Biden flip happened. I’m curious to see how this all plays out, but it is kinda insane how there was an instance of 100K+ gain for Biden in Wisconsin with 0 votes for literally any other candidate. This is getting juicy
The cameo of my dreams 
I think I need a little time... 
@Ki_ULT I didn’t even know about this. That’s busted
They took forever to call obvious states for Trump while instantly calling for Biden. The numbers are leaning but ya we gotta sleep on it 
RT @tomselliott : .@cenkuygur is starting to have a night 
@Paradicolost Fair enough
@chroclaps Lmfao
@chroclaps Kanye already lost. Go to bed
Who the fuck thought Texas would ACTUALLY go blue? Lol
So rare that it’s already gone  
RT @GNT_Jin : KENTUCKY LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 
@GNT_Jin LMFAO
@BeatyBean3965 THATS WHAT I SAID! I thought I was going fucking insane. CS;GO wannabe ass patches
I’m not gonna get any work done tonight fuck lmfao
@momo_not_feelin Depends. 2016 had some of the most hilarious ones but who knows. Either way it’s gonna be funny
Waiting for the massive copes
Nvm I got my answer 
@angel94051186 So you’re saying he still has a chance?
I wonder how many people actually wrote in Kanye West
"RT @GundamIsHere : It's weird to me that people today fear free speech so much. That an opposing idea or sense of humor is so abhorrent to them. It seems to me people only value their own freedom &amp; say to hell with everyone else's.
But such a viewpoint is a good way to end up in chains"
Only a little longer till these cancer ads stop playing so I can get back to my 30min Ulala and Rise of Kingdom ads.
RT @GlinkLive : The media doesn't want you to see this 
RT @DanStrife_ : New patch looks great :D 
RT @TheUncleAlShow : Strap in soldiers, it's that time of the year again 
@OnlyMagikarp @JBrinkins @AkimSSBM Define the words start and end for me please.
@OnlyMagikarp @JBrinkins @AkimSSBM You’re just conflating what I said with the definition when the entire discussion is linking back to the original post. Your argument is entirely disingenuous
@OnlyMagikarp I don’t think you understand what you’re commenting on.
@OnlyMagikarp @JBrinkins @AkimSSBM The ad literally says, “equitable treatment = same outcome”. No where did I say equity = communism smart guy
You’re right! Never seen a wheelchair ramp in America 
@SlushTV_ I use to live in Washington by the ocean. It fuckin sucks but when you get use to the heat snow becomes cool again lol
@SlushTV_ I live in a desert fudge u
@GlinkLive Yo have fun
"RT @RealYungCripp : ***ANNOUNCEMENT***

So this year as made me realize that politics are like super serious and it's my responsibility as someone with a sizable following to use my platform to promote politics in the form of merch

God bless America

@SlushTV_ Lucky
@vultstanding @whatishim First off, you follow me. Second off, you started off by arguing like a 12yr old that just got into politics who clearly wants attention. I’m not gonna waste my time in a VC with some random, rude follower on Twitter.
@whatishim @vultstanding Solid counter argument lmfao
@GlinkLive You’re fine. I just try to avoid political tweets so I don’t accidentally break my “funny guy” persona ranting about the economy and shit
@AkimSSBM This ad is saying that if you start at the same place, you have an equal outcome. The only way to make it equal is to make sure everyone has the same amount of wealth right? How else would it be equal? Otherwise there’s still a ruling class with an advantage
@William_Bracamo Equality of opportunity is good. I don’t think it’s possible or ethical to make sure everyone is wealthy. I think there’s people who don’t want to succeed much in life or go far. You can’t force them to do better either. Free Will is a bitch
@William_Bracamo You’re just ignorant if you believe you can save every “disadvantaged” person. If you’re trying to build a utopia it’s not gonna work.
@AkimSSBM Explain how to successfully pull everyone to the same tax bracket without starting a civil war.
@scaratlas @William_Bracamo I didn’t say monopolies were good either. It’d be a win to introduce regulation for that very reason.
@GlinkLive I blame you for putting this stuff on my timeline 
@William_Bracamo “Putting people on equal playing fields.” Is impossible on a universal scale. Disparity in wealth is a by product of free will and a free market.
@AkimSSBM You act like that isn’t worse while you’re playing the semantics game. “You must make specific considerations”, like pulling everyone down to the same economic status. How is that anything but communism
Being treated equally doesn’t automatically mean you’ll be as successful as anyone else. The government doesn’t hand you a decent work ethic u fucktards.
@KpopFuckinSucks 
@AkimSSBM No it’s not. “Equality of treatment means we all end up at the same place.” That’s not true at all
@KpopFuckinSucks I didn’t ask
Just unapologetically communist at this point. Equal treatment is expected. Equal outcome is forced. 
"RT @LivingScribe : You know what?

Id love to take the credit for this, but I have to give it back to you; the people.

What was a simple joke based off a whitewashed edit of Korra became a massive topic because you niggas can't shut the fuck up. 

You turned a dumb one-off joke into THIS.

Thanks.  "
@SlushTV_ I love that guy
Artists spent a whole month putting characters in black face so it’s only expected.
This #whitevember shit is even more hilarious when you realize it’s an elaborate troll by a black dude 
@WillyMacShow @inversedaniel I just lied about being a student and get the same discount
@SlushTV_ It fills me with rage every time I see it lmfao. Idk, if they get money off of it fuck it.
@OOHKAYEYE What the fuck Oki lmfao
Techrax is like the polar opposite of Mr. Beast 
@WillyMacShow @inversedaniel Do you pay for the adobe pack? I literally own all of it for audition and photoshop. I’m just a Vegas boy
@TringyTheMudkip Nah I’m convinced this is some manipulative dick head sitting behind his computer
First off, why is there a time limit to give them money, 4 QRT’s begging and someone with a functioning phone that hasn’t contacted family, friends or any other form of emergency relief? So obvious
"“You can be a hero today!” 

If this isn’t a fucking scam I’ll literally drink water. "
@AugieRFC @inversedaniel @WillyMacShow This post was made by the streamer gang
@inversedaniel @WillyMacShow I’ve heard that subtitling is much easier and honestly that’s huge. I fucking hate doing subtitles
@inversedaniel @WillyMacShow I’d switch to Premiere if I wasn’t so use to Vegas. Maybe in the future
@inversedaniel @WillyMacShow Vegas has this rare crash where the master volume dials turn blue and it stretches out every layer while slowing down the program. Most aggravating shit cuz when I reopen I have to readjust my layer sizes
@inversedaniel @WillyMacShow Wait...can you change the auto save rate on Vegas Pro 15?
@WillyMacShow It’s crazy how Premiere is almost just as ass as Vegas with crashing and mine was cracked. Fucking dog shit software
RT @Soul_Futility : #whitevember Day 1°: Superhero. 
@CosmosZR All that lewd art on the walls lol
@Big_Poof_ Too* ugly
@MrTuxedo12 Get better foo. Have a nice Halloween
@Big_Poof_ Get a bitch then
Love u too baby 💕 🦇 🎃 💀 
"RT @thekinocorner : 🚨Second Channel Video🚨

Since I felt bad about scrapping the video I had planned, I put together a blooper reel from my Halloween video! 

Thanks to @TheShuler and @sw33tr3l3as3 

RT's/Likes appreciated!

Happy Halloween!

 "
@SlushTV_ Not at all
@WillyMacShow What a chad
Soft 
 
@GlinkLive @SlushTV_ Well also everything we say as commentators gets screenshotted and held against us lol. Jumping the gun, unless you’re researching or some shit, is never a good choice for optics.
This is how it should be. Feels like I’m not living in a fucking clown simulation for once. 
@WillyMacShow NOT TOM
@GNT_Jin You didn’t even get comms banned playing with me wtf lol
@GlinkLive Can’t wait for Waifu Glink tbh
@SailorrLuna You got a bot in your replies lol
I gained em back lol. Just random people not use to different content 
@TreyEnma I’ll prob edit that and throw it on the new channel cuz it was some good stuff
@TaborTCU Lol
I pissed this drunk dude off in Valorant last night and got him to start ranting about his net worth. Truly embodying noob dog lmao
I think I’m gonna make another channel just for all the troll stuff after all. I’ll plug it in the next vid. I kinda wanna do streams of just that and see how it goes cuz that’s the only thing I can see myself enjoying streaming in the meantime.
@NewsM101 Lol I'm depressed in my room leave me alone
I’m lazy af but ty 
@Xaari123 The screen shots people are arguing about
Oh and the grooming.
I’m kinda sweatin’ about this Pyro shit ngl. What if he’s actually a furry? I can’t support that shit
@TreyEnma It’s like he’s a coon by default for attempting to make a difference lol. Working together was never an option
@thenameisSilent This is why I stopped following it. It’s legitimately bad for you
People get so caught up in politics that it’s not even about helping people anymore or being correct. It’s like watching mentally challenged sports fans
The guy*
People were on Kanye’s dick for “playing” Trump to get the reform he wanted but when Wayne works with what he has it’s a problem again. I fail to see how making an effort with the man in charge is an issue. You just gonna ignore the shit until u get they guy u want? Wtf 
@zaptiee Glad you’re not immediately jumping on the bandwagon despite your deep hatred of British people. Good on you mate
@LordShmeckie Me. I’m groomers
@WAR_TKay We’ve been through this shit. WAR never changes
Berleezy doesn’t do shit to no one on this platform besides vibe....are u kidding me? Stop messing with his bread 
Ok that’s enough Smash hate for one day. If there’s more substantial follow ups, I might consider bringing the detective in just to make everything more digestible. Drug video should be out in a few days
@WillyMacShow Holy fuck is this guy serious? Lol
"RT @WillyMacShow : You wouldn’t need to talk about “good faith” moderation if you just allowed free speech

“Good faith” moderation is completely subjective. "
@yaboiplaystand The irony is lost on them don’t even try lmfao
Can’t even form a solid decision without their head organizer having a meltdown on Twitter.
Pretty ironic considering this is coming from a partisan, ill managed group of volunteers that change decisions based on public outcry after hitting “send tweet”. 
@WillyMacShow Imagine if there’s was like a decent group of free thinker content creators. Smash probably wouldn’t be overrun by bots
@Tails_spl Not everyone was his friend that showed up at his house either. There’s levels to this shit
RT @ahri_EB : @Technicals_ top smash players crying on twitter after prematurely canceling someone for the 4,000,000th time: 
That whole clique of people Wizzy surrounds himself with are so fake. They treasure their 0 tolerance virtue signaling far more than actual friendships. It’s actually just sad at this point
This whole thread is a pity party and a half. As if he could of possibly been in a darker place than Nairo who he betrayed FRAME 1 while he was getting flooded with death threats. Just take the L
